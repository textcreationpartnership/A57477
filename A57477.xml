         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You know not what tentations and trialls God may yet bring you through.

            <p>Honourable Sirs, give mee leave to leave with you this monument and witneſſe of my thankfulneſſe for your many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited favours towards mee. I have abundant reaſon to think, that your hearts are right for God, and for the Kingdome of Chriſt: ſome cannot lay downe themſelves enough: if it were not ſo; whereas they doe ſome good, they would doe much more. Selfe-deniall makes a fat and fruitfull ſoule. Bleſſed be God for your obedience in this behalfe: then we love our ſelves beſt, when wee love God more then our ſelves; the matter of this diſcourſe will much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it. I know no better Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone

to attract and draw out affections to God ward, then Chriſt laid open in all the ſinews and joynts, in all the veines and arteries of his Fathers love to mankinde. I have done it very jejunely and brokenly: I leave the many defects of it to be made up by your meditation: how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have handled it, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, the ſubject is ſuch, that you will receive it, as I preſent it, with the right hand.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art not I conceive ſuch a ſtranger to theſe times but thou knoweſt, that there is a ſpirit of bitterneſſe and contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; whereby abundance of Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love is loſt, and our affections become unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto us: if wee could live more in the love of Chriſt; wee ſhould live more in the love one of another: this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe being firſt preached (through the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt importunity of many friends) is now printed for to elevate thy affections, and cauſe them to mount up with wings as Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles unto Chriſt, who is the delight of all delights, and abſtract of all prayſes.</p>
            <p>The Subject of this diſcourſe is the pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and unmatchable excellency of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:29795:8"/>
wherein is diſcover'd his rarity, price, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, with the high eſteeme that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puts upon him, in which reſpect he is precions to Beleevers. Love is the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Lord-ſtone of Love: and never was there ſuch a love-deſerving object as Chriſt; upon whom ſhould Saints place all their ſweet affections that are to be exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good, as love, joy, and delight; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him who is the brightneſſe of Gods face, and the expreſſe Image of his glory?</p>
            <p>It will be worth thy time to ſtudy the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, and tranſcendent excellency of Chriſt, he is precious and excellent in all relations, whether as man, as Mediatour, as God: he is attractive in his love, raviſhing in his beauty, winning and delightfull in all his graces: he is abſolute gaine, without loſſe, he is abſolute for all ſupply: in a word, all the riches of Gods love, the brightneſſe of his glory, and the ſhining of his face are treaſured up in Chriſt, and by our union with him we come to enjoy them.</p>
            <p>Now this excellency of Chriſt muſt not lie as a contemned thing: but it calls for the ſtrength of our ſoules, and the height of our affections to be fixed upon it. There is no object in the world, but there is a will relating to it, and inclinable to cloſe with
<pb facs="tcp:29795:8"/>
it. Now what better object can the will of man have then Chriſt? if wee be not here what doe we differ from beaſts? and a beaſt in the ſhape of a man is worſt of all. 'Tis good for us, that God hath placed ſuch ſweet affections of love, of joy, of delight, and the like in our ſoules; but it is much better, that God hath provided ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for them, as Chriſt, who is the <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> and the top of all felicity and happineſſe. It is pitie we ſhould loſe ſo much of our affections as we doe upon the world: when we caſt our affections upon Christ, they be not loſt: he onely makes them heavenly and gracious, and gives them to us againe: if we lay down our lives for him, they be not loſt, but gain'd unto eternall life.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed thee whereon this diſcourſe is grounded; namely in ſetting forth Chriſt in his beauty, in his love, in his graces, in his offices, in his riches, and in all the operations of his Spirit, in all thoſe rich and coſtly gifts, which he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon Beleevers, redeeming of them with his precious bloud, ſanctifying of them with his precious graces, enriching of them with his precious premiſes, reviving of them with his precious love, comforting of them
<pb facs="tcp:29795:9"/>
with his precious Spirit, and ennobling of them with precious priuiledges: and all this is, as an attractive Load-ſtone to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and draw our hearts unto him.</p>
            <p>Now if thou wilt but take a view of all the high perfections and ſupereminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Chriſt; if thou wilt anotomize him in every particular, and particularize him in every excellency, thou wilt find him to be lovely in all the parts of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, in his perſon, in his natures, all Offices, and Graces, yea, <hi>he is the chiefe, or Standard-bearer of ten thouſand: he is altogether lovely,</hi> be is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable. Now it is my earnest deſire, that as God hath honour'd his Sonne, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels they venerate him, and Saints highly eſteeme of him, that, hee might be precious unto thee, which is the chiefe thing I can deſire for my ſelfe, or for thee, who am</p>

            <p>The firſt thing he exhorts to, is to love the word of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>As new-borne</hi>

               <hi>babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word.</hi> To this he doth both prepare, and alſo give ſuitable and agreeable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. His preparation is in the firſt <hi>verſe; laying aſide all malice and all guile, &amp;c.</hi> his reaſons follow the Text: and the firſt is edification in theſe words, <hi>That you may grow thereby.</hi> The ſecond is taken from the Subject, or maine Argument of the word; and that is Chriſt, propounded unto us by taſte: <hi>if ſo be yee have taſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> ver. 3.</p>
            <p>Now that Chriſt is the primary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and cheife Argument of the word is declared from the fourth verſe unto the eleventh.</p>
            <p>Firſt in beleevers adhering to Chriſt by Faith, ſet forth to us under the terme of coming; <hi>to whom coming,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Then wee have the reaſons of this duty. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt is the foundation of the ſpirituall edifice or building, called therefore a <hi>livingſt one, verſe</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe Beleevers are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo made <hi>lively ſtones, verſe</hi> 5. Chriſt is the foundation; and Beleevers are the ſuperſtructure.</p>
            <p>Both theſe reaſons are illuſtrated:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29795:18"/>
Firſt, <hi>Chriſt was choſen and precious.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Beleivers <hi>were a holy Prieſthood.</hi> Now that Chriſt is a lively and precious ſtone, the Apoſtle confirmes by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture, verſe 6. <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a chiefe corner ſtone,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>He is precious,</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, he is to you that believe an honour, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. Prayſe, glory, and honour are promiſcuouſly and indifferently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for one and the ſame thing: but if we reſpect their propriety, they differ thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, praiſe, is when we make honourable mention of others: this is externall, and expreſſed by the tongue, or pen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29795:19"/>
Secondly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Glory is a reverend, and venerable opinion that we have of others: this is internall, lying in the mind.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Honour comprehends both thoſe, being a teſtification of the opinion, that wee have of other mens excellency and worth, declared by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes, as reſpectfull ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, uncovering the head, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee, and the like.

ſo acknowledge him to be that which he is: wee adde not any worth unto Chriſt; but onely an agnition or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his worth.</p>
            <p>I come to the ſecond queſtion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what manner of Faith it is, that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of? The Divine ſpeakes of three kinds of Faith; naturall, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and Evangelicall. The naturall Faith is to beleive that <hi>God is,</hi> or that there is a God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. generally all reaſonable Creatures, both Angels and men have ſuch a Faith as this: <hi>the Devils beleeve, that there is a God, and tremble,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>Legall faith is to beleive that God ſpeaks Truth in the Scriptures, or that the word of God is true; Hiſtories, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, Promiſes, threatnings, every line of that ſacred Text, as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dighted by the Spirit of God, they all breath out Truth, without the leaſt jot or tittle of falſhood in them. Now the Faith that aſſents to this is called Legall; becauſe the Law, and particularly the firſt Commandement injoynes me to honour God: and I doe honour him, when I beleeve, that which he ſaith is true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29795:20"/>
Evangelicall Faith is to beleive God in Chriſt. God is <hi>objectum ultimum fidei,</hi> the ultimate, or the higheſt object of Faith: and Chriſt is <hi>objectum mediatum,</hi> the mediate object thereof. Chriſt is the <hi>Medium</hi> by which we goe unto God: <hi>by him we beleeve in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. 21. and (ſaith <hi>Paul) we truſt through Chriſt to Godward,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
            <p>True Evangelicall Faith is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoule doth roll or caſt it ſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, as upon a ſufficient and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Saviour.</p>
            <p>And that this is the nature of Faith is declared by theſe phraſes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To leane upon the Lord: the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to leane produces and brings forth the word that ſignifieth a a ſtaffe; becauſe we leane upon it: now Faith in Scripture is ſet forth by both theſe termes: in reſpect of Faith the Lord is ſaid to be <hi>the ſtaffe of his people,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 19. and they are ſaid <hi>to leane or to ſtay themſelves upon him, Eſa.</hi> 10. 20. Againe, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies both confidence, hope and ſecurity, all which are effects of Faith: the radicall word is uſed to expreſſe the act of Faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 3. And very ſignificant and choyce
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29795:20"/>
to declare the worke of Faith is that phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>David,</hi> and to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 8. as much as to ſay, to roll ones ſelfe on the Lord. <hi>Arius, Montanus</hi> renders it, <hi>vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ad Dominum,</hi> roll <hi>to the Lord:</hi> the Hebrew word beſides the primative ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignification of rouling, imports alſo a confident committing of ones ſelfe unto another. Againe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Faith, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a ſteady or firme reſting upon the Promiſes of God. It is ſaid, <hi>Exodus</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now then ſeeing that to beleive in God is to leane upon him, as on a ſtaffe, or a ſupporter; to roule our ſelves to him, or on him, as Creatures that cannot ſubſiſt happily ſeparated from him; and alſo to reſt ſteadily in him, as in God al-ſufficient, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life and Salvation of our ſoules: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this cannot be done by an act of the underſtanding, but by an act of the will. Confidence indeed is a fruit of Faith<hi>:</hi> but yet you muſt take it thus: as it relates to God in dependance on him for ſome future good, ſo it is hope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:29795:21"/>
But as it reſpecteth him offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to us in Chriſt at preſent; ſo it is faith: and hence are thoſe phraſes of the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ground or reaſon of all, implyed in the word <hi>Therefore.</hi> It is a relative particle, importing ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, or fore-going reaſons of the preciouſneſſe of Chriſt to Beleevers, as—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he is found to be <hi>a precious ſtone, verſe</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Beleivers alſo are made by him <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> as wee read in the fift <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is likewiſe teſtimony of Scripture alledged to confirme the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29795:21"/>
of Chriſt: therefore he muſt needs be precious.</p>
            <p>The words afforde us theſe Doctrines or Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt is very honourable and precious. Chriſt is honoured in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, by God the Father, by the Holy-Ghoſt in the Scriptures, by his Angels and by Beleevers<hi>:</hi> all theſe put ſuch worth upon him, that <hi>hehe is the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, Cantic.</hi> the fift <hi>chap. verſe</hi> the tenth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, however Chriſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued by ſuch as have no faith, and doe not beleive: yet he is exceeding preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thoſe that doe beleive.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is precious to Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe of his proper and inherent excellency, called therefore <hi>a precious ſtone;</hi> becauſe of his uſefulneſſe, being a Foundation to build <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon<hi>:</hi> becauſe of his bleſſed efficiency or operation, making them that build upon him to become <hi>living,</hi> or <hi>lively ſtones;</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, becauſe all theſe beauties and lovelineſſes of Chriſt are not ſhucks and ſhadowes, but Truths and realities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by a ſure and infallible word of Prophecie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:29795:22"/>
I ſhall make bold to wave the firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe the ſubſtance and matter thereof ſhall be laid open in the ſecond, which was this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That though Chriſt be ſlighted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> 
               <hi>by unbeleevers; yet he is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding precious to Beleevers.</hi> Where there is faith to beleive, there Chriſt is highly eſteemed of, and precious above all the things in the world.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 44.</note> is likened to treaſure hid in a field, and to a goodly Margarite or pearle, which the Merchant having found he ſelleth all to buy it. Marke I pray.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>it is a Merchant man,</hi> and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants commonly are well ſtored with mony, and of the richeſt ſort of men: it was much then for ſuch an one to part with all that he had: ſurely that thing muſt n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eds be ſuperlatively excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that could move him to doe thus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>it is a Merchant,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifies a Merchant, doth alſo ſignifie a Seeker or ſearcher, becauſe Merchants doe ſearch up and downe in diverſe Countries for their precious things: this notes the great paines that is taken about the Pearle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:29795:22"/>
Thirdly, when he hath made up his reſolution thus to forſake all, obſerve his policy: <hi>he hides the Pearle and the treaſure,</hi> craftily he conceales it and keeps it cloſe, that ſo he may make it ſure to himſelfe, and that no man may deprive him of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>he ſelleth all,</hi> to ſhew that he values it above all things in the world; and would rather part with all, then miſſe of ſuch a bargaine.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>he ſelleth all with joy:</hi> that which he doth, he doth with a very good will, ſo farre from any ſticking at it, ſo farre from any repenting or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, ſo farre from any changing of mind; that he perſiſts in his reſolution with a cheerefull and joyfull heart. Now what is the ground and reaſon of all this? verily it is Chriſt a treaſure, a Pearle of ineſtimable and unvaluable price; this is the thing that the ſoule like a politick Merchant-man eyes all this while, and is glad to leave all to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
            <p>See this in the Apoſtle: he counted all things but loſſe for the excellency of Chriſt: yea he counted them but <hi>dung,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29795:23"/>
               <hi>that I may winne or gaine</hi> Chriſt, ſaith he: that is, that I may get more neare communion with him; and that I may be ſatisfied with a larger portion of his fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo counted the worſt of Chriſt better then the beſt of ſinne: nothing can be imagined worſe of Chriſt then reproach and affliction: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets theſe againſt the pleaſures of ſinne and the treaſures of <hi>Egypt: he choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproacb of Chriſt better riches, then the treaſures of Egypt, Hebr.</hi> 11. 26.</p>
            <p>Now beſide theſe examples, I will endeavour further to prove and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Doctrine in this method.

            <p>Firſt Beleevers are very impatient of Chriſts abſence. Chriſt may vaile <note place="margin">I <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </note> himſelfe for a while, and withdraw his Light and comfort from the ſoule: though he take not away his loue, yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29795:23"/>
he may ſuſpend the acts of it<hi>:</hi> he may ſeeme to frowne; he may ſo abſcond, ſo hide and ecclipſe himſelfe, that the ſoule for a while loſeth ſenſe, and feeles not its owne happineſſe. Now when it is thus with a Beleiver, Chriſt is gone: the comfort and aſſurance of his Love is gone, joy and Light is gone, ô how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, how diſconſolate is the ſoule then! ſo far as a man is ſpirituall, the flame of love to Chriſt is kindled in him: <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Malim praeſente Chriſto eſſe in inferno, quàm ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto in Coelo.</hi> Luther <hi>in</hi> Geneſ.</note> and then he cannot ſit down without him. He is the fountaine of all ſupply: he is the ſtaffe of ſtrength, the ſupport of joy, and the very life of the ſoule: ô that I might ſee him (ſaith the Beleiver) oh that I might live in his preſence! nothing in the world will content him, neither honour, nor riches, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor friends, nor any thing elſe will content him, till he find him whom his ſoule loveth, till he finde the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom formerly with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable pleaſure he enjoyed. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Demo. </seg>II</label>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider that earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition and diligent ſearch, which the Beleiver makes after Chriſt when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>He ſeekes him diligently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29795:24"/>
Firſt, his diligence appeareth in that he ſearcheth for Chriſt in the uſe of all holy Ordinances: who ſo eſteemeth Chriſt, the ſame perſon can ſlight no Ordinance of Chriſt, hearing, prayer, meditation, conference with the godly, and the like: he hath found ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all theſe, that he cannot give over his ſearch and inquirie, untill he hath found Chriſt. Thoſe Ordinances are (as I may ſay) a walke wherein Chriſt is wont to meet with his people: a Beleiver therefore doth with great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſſe, delight and ſtudy put himſelf upon that way. If he finde not Chriſt preſent, his ſpirit failes; the ſoule is in a ſyncope or fit of ſwooning, there is a ſwift and a ſudden failing of ſtrength. But Chriſt being once found, this is as life from the dead. The Ordinances ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in which Chriſt preſents and offers himſelfe are very precious to a Beleiver. The ſoule that hath once felt the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of thoſe Ordinances, will hardly, or never be kept from them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the true Beleiver ſeekes Chriſt conſtantly, he ſeeks him without intermiſſion or ceaſing. See a pattern of this, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>By night on my</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:29795:24"/>
               <hi>bed I ſought him,</hi> ſaith the Church: and what was the ſucceſſe? for the preſent <hi>ſhe found him not:</hi> how then? did ſhe give over? no<hi>:</hi> but <hi>ſhe ſought him in the ſtreets:</hi> and yet ſhe found him not, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Well, ſhe is not contented; but ſhe ſeek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him againe: <hi>ſhe askes the watchmen</hi> for him; ſuch as were in place of ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency and Miniſtry; ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at leaſt to have the greateſt care of her<hi>:</hi> ſhe inquires of them for him: <hi>ſaw yee him whom my ſoule loveth, ſaith ſhe?</hi> but even they ſatisfie her not: therefore ſhe goes further, waiting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the Revelation of Chriſt: and ſo at length ſhe hath bleſſed ſucceſſe: ſhe found her beloved: it is not loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſeeke and waite for Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and perſeveringly: ſuch labour in the Lord ſhall never be in vaine: and verily they doe highly eſteeme of Chriſt, who ſeek him ſo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a true Beleiver doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>III</label> ſeeke Chriſt diligently and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but alſo he hath a prudentiall care in keeping him when he hath found him. <hi>I held him (ſaith the Church) and would not let him goe, Cant.</hi> 3. 4. ſhe came by him hardly: and therefore ſhe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29795:25"/>
will not part with him lightly, it coſt her hot water (as I may ſay) to get him; ſhe gat him with much hazard and danger, much loſſe and ſuffering: and therefore ſhe will not leave him for the greateſt advantage in the world. She knowes, that nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can countervaile or repaire the loſſe of him: ſhe knowes, that nothing in this great and wide Univerſe, though never ſo lovely and deſireable can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to ſuch a Jewell: She knowes, that with him is the well-ſpring of life and of all bleſſing: therefore ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be induced or perſwaded upon any tearmes to part with him. Many of Chriſts followers forſooke him, and went no more with him: but <hi>will yee alſo forſake me, ſaith</hi> he to his Apoſtles? <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers for himſelfe and the reſt: <hi>Lord, whither ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life,</hi> Joh. 6. 68. as if he ſhould have ſaid: Lord, if wee leave thee, we leave our life and our comfort; wee forſake our owne mercy: it was motive enough to ſtay by him, and to keep cloſſe to him to conſider that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life, and conſequently the very quinteſſence of all happineſſe was with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29795:25"/>
him. The Merchant that found a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of great price, <hi>went and hid it,</hi> and <hi>joyfully ſold all that he had</hi> to purchaſe it: and therefore he will not part with it for any good. This Merchant-man is an Embleme or figure of a ſound belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who when he hath found Chriſt, will not forgoe him by any meanes: no, but he will ſay of him, whom have I in Heaven but thee: and on Earth there is none that I deſire in compariſon of thee<hi>: Chriſt is the ſtrength of his heart, and his portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73. 25, 26. 'Tis the voyce of the Church: <hi>the Lord is my portion</hi> ſaith my ſoule: not onely her tongue without; but even her ſoule and her ſpirit within ſpeakes it with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable joy and delight: ſhe was in deep affliction when ſhe ſpake it, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 24. Yet the apprehenſion of ſuch a portion, as the Lord, was ſolace and refreſhing enough to her. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is in the ſame moode too: <hi>the Lord is my portion and mine inheritance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the lines are fallen unto me in pleaſant places, yea, I have a goodly heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16. 5, 6.

            <p>Fourthly, conſider the principle from <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>IV</label> whence flowes the ſoules bewailing of Chriſts abſence, diligent and conſtant ſeeking of him, and keeping him with much care and jealouſie when ſhe hath found him; that principle is love. <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoule loveth,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 3, 4. Now love is the inclining or cloſing of the will, with ſomething that is at leaſt apprehended to be excellent and agreeable to it ſelfe: I ſay apprehended to be excellent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes the object is not excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent indeed, but onely fanſied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited to be ſuch: but here the caſe is otherwiſe, as I truſt it ſhall appeare.

            <p>Againe we muſt know, that the object of the will according to the mind of the Philoſopher is ſomething that is good: <hi>bonum eſt objecium voluntatis,</hi> ſaith the Moraliſt<hi>:</hi> whether it be <hi>bonumreale,</hi> a reall and ſubſtantiall good; or <hi>bonum apparens,</hi> a ſhadowiſh and ſeeming good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſo; both are the object of the will<hi>:</hi> but Chriſt is altogether ſubſtance and no ſhadow, no lye, no falſhood, no fuke, no varniſhed appearance of good; but the moſt ſolid, and abſolute bleſſing, that is in the world; ſo revealed by the Spirit, and ſo apprehended by the Saints: and therefore it is, that he is ſo choyce and precious to them.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſtration. </seg>I</label> thing makes it to be precious: for this cauſe is the word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of Propheſie called precious, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. It is ſaid there, <hi>that the word of God was precious,</hi> that is, it was rare in thoſe days: ſo is Chriſt rare in the world: few and rare they be that find him: <hi>one of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and two of a Tribe,</hi> as 'tis in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Chriſt is a Pearle, yea a Pearle of higheſt price, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.

If things excellent were common, the plentineſſe of them would take off the price of them: it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29795:29"/>
ſaid 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 21. <hi>that all Solomons drinking veſſels, and all the veſſels of the Forreſt houſe in Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of Silver, it was nothing accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in the dayes of Solomon:</hi> the King made it as common as ſtones in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as we read in <hi>verſe</hi> 27. The exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſuperabounding quantity of that mettall made it ſo cheape and ſo worthleſſe, as it was: had it been rarer, it would have been more precious: this then confirmes the exceeding preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, becauſe they be thinne ſowne, and come up as thinly, that have him for their portion: the paucity and fewnes of ſuch, as are enriched with him, argues his dignity and worth not a little.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the high eſteeme, that is caſt upon a thing makes it alſo to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſtration. </seg>II</label> ſo is Gold and Silver precious, becauſe men make great account of it. Neither doth Chriſt come ſhort of this Argument: whatſoever worldlings account of him, it skils not: fooles and mad-men cannot judge of excellencies; Let the fooliſh <hi>Gadarens</hi> eſteeme more of their ſwine, then of Chriſt; we will not lay him in ſuch a balance: looke upon God the Father, and ſee what

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29795:30"/>

This is a great myſtery: but God ſpeaks of it in tearmes very quaint and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar. Chriſt ſpeaking of the dayes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and everlaſtingneſſe, ſaith that he was <hi>alwayes rejoycing before God;</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">

Chriſt muſt needs be precious, being thus highly eſteemed of the Father. And to this head of Argumentation wee may adde the great and high account that the moſt excellent of all Gods Creation, the holy Angels have of him, they all worſhip him, and adore him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 6. yea they doe exceeding earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to <hi>ſtoope downe and pry</hi> into the great myſtery of our Redemption by Chriſt, as the words <gap reason="foreign">

Angels to looke into the ſeverall ſcopes of our ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the whole frame and fabrick of it, to obſerve all the parts of it from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, and the glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, his wiſdome, his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his Juſtice, his Mercy, all ſhining and glittering in it like bright Starres in the firmament: this, I ſay, is their worke: yea this is their feſtivity and paſt-time. Then let the profane ones of the world thinke what they will of Chriſt; let them ſlight him, and ſcorne him, and caſt him at their heeles, as they doe; let them trample upon his bloud and paſſion, as their wicked man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner is, making it a common and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thing; let them deſpiſe thoſe high and celeſtiall Myſteries of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip; wee need not care for their thoughts; it is enough for us, that God the Father hath honoured and exalted him, that the holy Angels doe venerate and worſhip him; yea and all the Saints doe magnifie him, and count him very precious: the opinion, that one of the leaſt of theſe hath of Chriſt, is more to be regarded, then the Judgement of the wiſeſt and moſt judicious worldlings,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29795:31"/>
that are. The Preacher ſaith, that <hi>a wiſe mans heart is at his right hand; but a fooles at his left, Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 2. what is the meaning of this? Wee know, that naturally every mans heart is placed on the left ſide: therefore ſurely that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence aimeth at ſomething higher then Nature: doubtleſſe then Heavenly things are figured by the right hand, and Earthly by the left. The firſt is the choyce of the Saints: they are therefore thoſe wiſe ones, whoſe heart is at their right hand: the other is the delight of Heatheniſh and carnall people: they then are the fooles, whoſe heart is on their left hand: and here is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the men of this world doe deſpiſe Chriſt, their heart is a left-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart (as I may ſay) they favour and relliſh nothing but earthly things: and therefore Chriſt and the glorious things of the Goſpel are lightly ſet by: ſuch wiſedome is too high for fooles, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, they cannot attaine unto it. Even the Heathen Philoſophers as wiſe as they were, could not reach it: they were ſo farre from embracing it, that they counted it very fooliſhneſſe: and be it ſo (ſaith the Apoſtle, for he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29795:31"/>
doth after a ſort gratifie them) <hi>yet the fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men; and the weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men.</hi> It skils not then what the men of the world doe thinke of Chriſt: but what eſteeme God, and his holy Angels, and the Saints illuminated and enlightned by the Spirit of God have of him: if they count him precious; this is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument irrefragable, and a proofe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception, that he is ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the great and exceſſive price, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſtration. </seg>III</label> that is given for a thing, doth likewiſe render it very precious. Precious things have their denomination from this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The oyle, wherewith <hi>Mary</hi> anoynted Chriſt, was called precious in this reſpect: <hi>this oyntment might have been fold for much, and given to the poore.</hi> Thus alſo the life of a man is ſaid to be precious, <hi>Proverb.</hi> 6. 26. becauſe he will part with one thing after another, till all begone to ſave it: as wee ſee in the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who parted firſt with their mony, after that with their cattell; and laſt of all with their Lands; and all to buy bread to ſave their precious lives. Now this alſo doth ſet forth the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt: but who ſhall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29795:32"/>
him? Who ſhall ſet the price upon him? not men of corrupt minds, not people of depraved affections: for they will ſet too low a rate upon him. <hi>Judas</hi> ſold him, and the High-Prieſts bought him for 30. pieces of ſilver; <hi>a goodly price (ſaith Chriſt) that I was priſed at of them</hi> Zach. 11. 13. <hi>Magnificum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, as Junius</hi> renders it: <hi>a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy price, I promiſe you:</hi> ironically ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, meaning nothing leſſe; and yet he was no leſſe then the eternall <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that was ſo priſed: <hi>Jehovah ſaid unto me; caſt it unto the potter; a goodly price, that I was priſed at of them.</hi> But they did thus to fulfill the good Counſell and purpoſe of God for others, that would eſteeme more highly of him. There be them in the world, that doe enhaunſe the price of Chriſt, and value him at the higheſt rate: though ſome will not part with a beaſtly luſt for him; though like hogs they count the baſe waſh and figge to be farre ſweeter: yet there be others, that know well the worth of him: there be others that are willing to forſake all for him: <hi>we have forſaken all</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>and have followed thee, Matth.</hi> 19. 27. The Merchant, of whom
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29795:32"/>
you heard before, ſold all to buy the preclous pearle<hi>:</hi> he valued it above all things in the world, and was willing to leave all for it. The holy Martyrs thought not their very lives, and their heart-bloud too deare for Chriſt: ſo it is ſaid, that they <hi>loved not their lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, Revel.</hi> 12. 11. that is, they deſpiſed their lives in compariſon of Chriſt: they expoſed their bodies to horrible and painfull deaths, their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtates to the ſpoyle, and their perſons to all manner of ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the cauſe of Chriſt: they thought nothing too hot for him. A ſoule, that by Faith hath ſenſe of the worth of Chriſt, will willingly give all for him, will goe away rejoycing, and will thinke his pennie-worth to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the uſefulneſſe and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſtration. </seg>IV</label> of a thing makes it alſo to be precious: in this ſenſe are the fruits of the Earth called precious, as we reade, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 14. there the precious fruits put forth by thoſe heavenly luminaries, the Sunne and Moone, are a part of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> bleſſing<hi>:</hi> and precious they were, becauſe very uſefull and ſerviceable to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29795:33"/>
the life of man: and the influence of thoſe heavenly bodies by a courſe, which God had conſtituted and ſet in Nature, made them the more uſefull, and therefore the more precious. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are the afflicted and perſecuted Saints ſaid to beare precious ſeed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 6. becauſe their ſufferings ſhall profit them much in the end: ſuch ſeed ſhall bring forth weighty ſheaves of joy at the laſt. Now then, to come to the point, that we drive at, in this manner doth the Scripture hold forth Chriſt as precious: he is very precious; becauſe he is very uſefull: he is uſefull for many things, yea for all things; but eſpecially for theſe two,</p>

hence we are ſaid to be made <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. marke, I pray. The Apoſtle doth diſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and emphatically adde the clauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in him,</hi> that he may take away all conceit of inherence in us, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Doctrine of imputation: as Chriſt is made ſinne in us by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo wee are made righteouſneſſe in him by the ſame way. St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> place, which <hi>Beza</hi> cites, is a moſt full commentary: God the Father (ſaith he) made him to be ſinne, who knew no ſinne; that we might be the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, not our owne, and in him, that is, in Chriſt, not in our ſelves. And being thus juſtified, we are ſo righteous, as if we were righteouſneſſe it ſelfe. It is Chriſt alone, that can adminiſter life and righteouſneſſe: it is he alone, <hi>that bindes up the broken-hearted, opens the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dores, proclaimes Liberty to Captives, and the acceptacle yeare of the Lord, or the Lords yeare of good will:</hi> the Quire of the heavenly hoſt ſang <hi>good will towards men,</hi> when this accepted and welcome yeare was come, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14. This was Chriſts worke: <hi>the Law was too weake for it:</hi> that could kill, but not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alive.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29795:34"/>
Chriſt alone bare the whole weight of his Fathers wrath, made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for iniquity, and brought in everlaſting righteouſneſſe: none but he was of uſe for this; and therefore he muſt needs be precious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is likewiſe uſefull for Sanctification, that Spirit alone, which Chriſt ſends forth, is of power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to inſtill and breath grace into us, and ſo make us meet veſſels for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly maſters uſe. It is Chriſt, that ſtamps afreſh the impreſſion of Gods Image defaced and decayed in our ſoules: it is he that reſtores the life of God in man, loſt by ſinne, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed influxe and droppings of his grace <hi>we come to put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 10. he uſes a Metaphor of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on taken from garments, to ſhew that thoſe new qualities of the ſoule are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29795:34"/>
wee derive from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The parts of Sanctification are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, a dying unto ſinne, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification, a living unto righteouſneſſe: now both theſe come by vertue of our implantation, inſerting, or ingraffing into Chriſt: the firſt when wee are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into his death, and the ſecond is a fruit of his reſurrection: Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, his members could not lie dead: a living head and dead members were a Monſter never ſeen in nature. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe obſerve this; that though wee are ſanctified by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt: yet his death is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> as I may ſay, that ſtrikes the firſt ſtroke, that is the meritorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory cauſe of our ſanctification, and hence is that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. If we have been planted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the likeneſſe of his death; wee ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: this is an elegant metaphor, repreſenting unto us, that as plants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed doe receive moyſture, juyce, and nouriſhment from the ſtock, whereby they ſprout out, budde, and beare fruit; ſo wee being as it were inſerted into Chriſt, doe receive vigour and life from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29795:35"/>
him, whereby we walke in the Spirit, and become ſpirituall, holy, gracious, and active in all good workes. Chriſt is the <hi>Olive tree, that ſtandeth before the Ruler of the whole Earth, and emptieth it ſelfe by the pipes and conduits of his word into the golden Candleſticks of his Church Zach.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He makes there Chriſt to be the Head, and the Church the body knit together by certaine joynts, and ligaments, as wee ſee it is in nature: and by this meanes it hath convenient nouriſhment miniſtred to all parts, whereby it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth with the increaſe of God, that is, with mighty and moſt bleſſed increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Chriſt hath goodneſſe enough for himſelfe, and for all his Members: he is a Fountaine never drie; and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers property of good agrees to him moſt of all: <hi>Bonum eſt ſui commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicativum:</hi> that which is good ſpares no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29795:35"/>
like water, of which the Naturaliſt ſaith, that it is difficultly contained within its owne bounds; but eaſily within the bounds of ſome other thing. Chriſt is that ſunne of righteouſneſſe, that compaſſeth the whole world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, warming, and cheriſhing every one of his elect with his beames, <hi>of his fulneſſe we all receive, and grace for grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, abundant grace, or graces ſutable to his owne. The firſt day of union a Beleever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes this participation of grace.

            <p>Firſt, when the ſoule findes it ſelfe in darkneſſe without any Light; lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhame and diſhonour: under the guilt of ſinne, and not able to deliver it ſelfe: this cannot but make it looke out for it ſelfe, and ſeeke with great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for a Saviour.

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:29795:37"/>

Now when the ſoule is ſenſible of this, it crieth out (as <hi>Peter</hi> in another caſe) help Lord, or elſe I periſh.</p>

Saviour, of a Redeemer, this is welcome newes indeed; this is as cold water to a thirſty ſoule.</p>
            <p>An inſtance of this is ſeen in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall: who, <hi>when he came to himſelfe,</hi> that is, when he ſaw what a wretched and helpleſſe creature he was, <hi>he caſt his thoughts upon his Fathers houſe,</hi> he loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any longer to feed upon the <hi>huskes</hi> and hogs meat of the world, then he deſires <hi>the bread of his Fathers hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:</hi> Nothing but home will content him: farewell feaſting and revelling, and all filthy pleaſures that I have lived in: I have gotten nothing by them, but wounds, and ſorrowes, and vexation of Spirit: I will home to my Fathers houſe: there is bread and durable cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: there is whatſoever I can wiſh or deſire: here I ſtarve and die<hi>:</hi> there I ſhall live and ſweetly enjoy my ſelfe: here I want all things; but there I ſhall lack nothing. This is a lively pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of a thirſty and wearied ſoule flying unto Chriſt for eaſe and comfort. This then is one reaſon why Chriſt is precious to Beleevers; namely, becauſe they are in ſome meaſure convinced of their miſery with him: and of their

owne impotency and utter inability to help themſelves, therefore Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beleevers are not onely <label type="milestone">

            <p>The love of God being infinite like himſelfe, cannot be conferred upon any creature for its owne ſake: the <hi>cauſa pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatrix,</hi> or the procuring cauſe of this love muſt of neceſſity be infinitely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious: now this is not found among the ſonnes of men, but onely in Chriſt the eternall Sonne of God; onely in Chriſt, who was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God-man, as I may ſay; <hi>Immanuel, God with us, or God in our fleſh:</hi> God, that he might be a fit object for the infinite love of his Father; and man, that he might derive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29795:38"/>
and bring that love to us. God firſt loves his Sonne, and then Beleivers through him. It is impoſſible that the infinite love of the infinite God ſhould bee drawne out, but by an infinite motive: and where is this motive, but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon coe-eternall, co-eſſentiall, and co-equall with the Father? were it not for his Sonne, God ſhould have no object for his love in the world. Love is as fire, which muſt have fewell to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. Now let all the Creatures, men and Angels be ſet before God; yet they all with all their excellencies and lovely parts cannot deſerve the leaſt minute or tittle of his Love. God loves himſelfe in his Sonne, and his creatures for his beloved Sonnes ſake. <hi>God will ſupply</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all your need according to his riches in Glory by Jeſus Chriſt, Philip.</hi> 4. 9. The treaſures of Gods love and riches are firſt in Chriſt; and by our union with him wee come to enjoy them. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in which he hath ingratiated us through that Beloved.</hi> Gods love and his favour is undeſerved on our parts:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29795:39"/>
wee finde grace in his ſight through Chriſt. Notable to this purpoſe is the order of the three perſons, which the Apoſtle ſets, <hi>Cor.</hi> the laſt and the laſt. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Ho-Ghoſt be with you all, Amen.</hi> You muſt know now, that this is not a right na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall order: for by order of nature the Father (whom the Apoſtle cal's God in a perſonall ſenſe, as <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>the word was with God,</hi> that is, with the Father) I ſay by order of nature the Father is firſt of himſelfe, not begotten: the Son is from the Father begotten; yet eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: and the Holy Ghoſt is proceeding from them both; yet eternally too: for though they be one before another in order of nature; yet not in order of time. But now here is the Queſtion: ſeeing the Father is firſt, the Sonne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the Holy Spirit laſt in that naturall order; why doth the Apoſtle in the fore-mentioned place ſet the Sonne firſt? verily becauſe he is next and immediate unto us, being our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour; being the <hi>canalis</hi> or conduit pipe (as I may ſay) by which the love of God, and the communion of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29795:39"/>
Holy-Ghoſt is brought and conveyed to us; as the meanes is ever before the end. Now the Saints being convinced and perſwaded of this Truth, this is the thing, that makes Chriſt ſo deare and precious unto them, as he is: if <hi>Iſaac</hi> loved <hi>Eſau</hi> for his veniſon, for a carnall reſpect<hi>:</hi> much more have wee cauſe to love the Lord Jeſus, and highly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of him, having procured for us the love of the Father; a love like <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan's</hi> love to <hi>David,</hi> paſſing the love of women: yea a love of infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions and meaſures, if I may ſo ſpeake: the breadth of it is infinite; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is without reſpect of perſons: the length alſo infinite; becauſe it is from everlaſting to everlaſting: the depth infinite; becauſe it redeemes and delivers from Hell<hi>:</hi> and the height likewiſe infinite; becauſe it lifts us up to Heaven. Certainly Chriſt having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſuch a wonderfull love, as this; he muſt needs be precious, he muſt needs be amiable and lovely to a beleeving ſoule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the pardon of ſinne there is likewiſe an abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt. The bloud of Chriſt onely, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29795:40"/>
not of Buls and Goats, is availeable to take away ſinnes. The ſoule being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of its ſinfulneſſe, ſpeakes as the Prophet doth<hi>: Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> God is devouring fire and everlaſting bumings in relation to ſinners: his wrath is the fewell of Hell, as I may ſay: the breath of his indignation is like a river of brimſtone kindling and perpetually maintaining the flames of <hi>Tophet:</hi> what ſhall the poore ſinfull ſoule doe now? here's nothing but menaces and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, terrours and amazements, death and deſtruction: and where is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? verily no where but in Chriſt alone. <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſing through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe had a cloud to cover him, and defend him from the ſcortching Sunne-beames: now what was this cloud but a type and ſhadow of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle makes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1.? hee makes there the cloud, and the Sea, and the Manna, and the water of the Rocke to be all figures and Images of Chriſt. Chriſt is a ſea to waſh, Manna to feed, water to refreſh, and a cloud to hide the ſoule from the hot and burning
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29795:40"/>
wrath of God<hi>:</hi> the fiery beames of that wrath would ſurely ſuffocate it and ſtifle it, were not the bloud of Chriſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſet between to veile it: the bloud of Chriſt obnubilates and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the ſoule from the fierce anger of God; it is Chriſt onely that reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us to God: it is he alone that is our Advocate to plead our cauſe with his Father: when man had ſinned, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy ſtrove one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; ſeemed to be at variance: Chriſt redintigrates them, and makes them friends againe: he is our bleſſed Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to ſet there two together againe; giving ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and place to mercy; ſo honouring and dignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both; making both to rejoyce, both to kiſſe and embrace each other. God ſmels a ſweet ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur of reſt in Chriſt onely: all the hilaſticall and propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory ſacrifices of the Law did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oke to him, as to their end and ſubſtance: of themſelves they could not pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge away the guilt of the leaſt ſinne: the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ſhowes plainely how invalid they were to expiate the crimes and offences of the ſoule: the ſtricteſt obſervance of them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29795:41"/>
could not make the worſhipper perfect, as touching <hi>cleereneſſe of Conſcience, Heb.</hi> 9. 9. When <hi>David</hi> cryes, <hi>purge me with byſope, and I ſhall be cleane; waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow;</hi> he alludes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the Leviticall Ceremony: but he aimes at the bloud of Chriſt onely: this alone was able to purge away his foule ſpot: his hainous ſinne of murder would not out by any other waſhing then this. In one of the old ſacrifices there were two Goates appointed; one to be ſlaine, and the other to be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, which was called the ſcape-Goate: now both theſe have an eye to Chriſt: the ſlaine or ſacrificed Goate was a type of his dying for ſinne: and the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or ſcape-goate figures his riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and ever living to mainetaine the worth of that oblation: the Apoſtle ſaith, that he ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us: and how doth he make interceſſion, but by continuall holding forth in the preſence of his Father the merit of his ſufferings? ſo that ſtill Chriſt both dying and living is the fountaine of our peace, and attonement with God: ſtill Chriſt is he, and the onely he, that obtaineth remiſſion of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29795:41"/>
ſinnes for us. Now if wee conſider the many and great benefits that redound to us by the pardon of ſinne, we muſt needs conclude that Chriſt is very precious, by whom we enjoy ſuch a mercy.</p>
            <p>When ſinne is pardoned, there is an end of Gods heavie wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Satan's Kingdome goes downe; the power of our corruptions daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying: we have peace and joy within; whereas before wee had nothing but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſtormes and tempeſts, and a very hell in our Conſciences: our prayers finde acceptance at the throne of Grace: all the creatures are in league with us, and are become our faithfull ſervants: that which comes from them, is ſweet and benigne, healthfull and good: our bleſſings are bleſſed: yea our very curſes (if they may be ſo called) are likewiſe bleſſed unto us: Judgements are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: every bitterneſſe is taken away: even the ſting of death is puld our: Chriſt, as a tree of moſt excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is cut downe, and throwne into our <hi>Marah.</hi> Some things may worke adve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſly and croſly to us: but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes of a <hi>cooperating, or working together;</hi> which makes amends for all:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29795:42"/>
               <hi>all things, worke together</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for good unto them that love God, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. and they be ſuch, that have their ſinnes pardoned.</p>
            <p>Though ſome things worke unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and againſt the haire, as I may ſay; yet take them altogether, and there is a bleſſed harmony and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a ſweet reliſhableneſſe and ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe in them: one thing doth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and make up another: the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſweet and ſowre through the wiſdome and mighty working of God is very demulcent and wholſome, full of benediction and bleſſedneſſe; that even the ſinnes of the Godly are an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, and turne to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration and betternment: God makes uſe even of them to doe his children good: he brings <hi>meate out of the very eater;</hi> and converts the cauſes of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into furtherances of ſalvation.

               </gap>lory are all of them the bleſſed concomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ants of ſinne pardoned. We recover the Image of God, and in ſome meaſure the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our wills unto good, when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29795:42"/>
our Conſciences are waſhed, and our ſinnes pardoned. We have a continuall feaſt in our ſoules, and ſongs in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night of affliction, when our ſinnes are pardoned. Wee are freed from the ſpirit of bondage, our hearts are ſtrong, we are as bold as Lyons, and deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the preſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Judge, when our ſinnes are pardoned. Oh what a confluence of all bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe is there in Jeſus Chriſt! if we have him, wee are rich, we are full, we have all: if wee be without him, all that we have, how excellent ſoever it be, is as nothing: we are miſerable, wretched, loſt, and the very worſt of creatures: all the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and curſes of God lie upon us, and death, when it comes, will gnaw upon us everlaſtingly. Certainly, Chriſt muſt needs be exceeding precious, with whom wee enjoy ſuch a world of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; and without whom wee are ſo extreamely unhappy. The Lord give us to know the things, that belong unto our peace. Chriſt procures for us the pardon of ſinnes; and the pardon of ſinnes is not a ſolitary bleſſing; it comes not alone; but with a long traine of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29795:43"/>
good things at the heeles of it: Chriſt therefore, that obtaines it, muſt needs be precious and excellent in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is Chriſt alone, that doth as it were unmask and unvaile the face of God; and helps us to ſuch a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation and ſight of it, as our nature is capable of: his glory in the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfection of it no creature can behold. When <hi>Job</hi> had ſet forth the greatneſſe of Gods wiſdome and power expreſſed in his marvellous workes; he concludes thus: <hi>Loe, theſe are part of his wayes: but how little a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can underſtand? Job</hi> 26. <hi>laſt verſe:</hi> now that thunder of Gods power is the higheſt degree of it: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expounds it, when he ſaith, <hi>that God is able to doe above all that wee can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aske, or thinke:</hi> we can aske much; and we can thinke more: yet wee can neither aske, nor thinke ſo much as God can doe: here's the <hi>thunder of his power, Zophar</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>we cannot finde out the Almighty unto perfection:</hi> he compares it in height to Heaven, in depth to Hell, in length to the Earth,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29795:43"/>
and in breadth to the Sea: yea he makes it higher, deeper, longer and broader, then all theſe. And God himſelfe tells <hi>Moſes, that no man can ſee his face, and live.</hi> We may ſee <hi>Jehovah's</hi> back-parts: but his face, that is, his abſoluteneſſe, and perfection cannot be ſeen: and therefore he is called the <hi>inviſible God.</hi> Yet howſoever this doth not a little ſet forth the excellency and worthineſſe of Chriſt: that Revelation, which wee have of God, we have it by him: and hereof wee may ſee a notable figure in <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Lord proclaimed his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his patience, his goodneſſe, his Truth, and his juſtice before him: theſe are his backparts; and more then theſe he could not ſee: and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord covered Moſes with his hand, while he paſſed by.</hi> But to come now to the point: where was <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he had this viſion and appearance of the Deity? he was in <hi>a clift of the Rocke:</hi> now verily that Rock was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt: wee ſee the glory of God through him <hi>per ſpeculum,</hi> as it were in a glaſſe. Chriſt is the <hi>lively Image of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. He is the <hi>brightneſſe of his glory, and the expreſſe character of</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:29795:44"/>
               <hi>his perſon, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the Father, which is not compleate in the Sonne: and by the Sonne we come to know it: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>God, who hath commanded the Light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our hearts to give the Light of the Knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. both this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and that in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, where Chriſt is called the <hi>brightneſſe of Gods glory,</hi> are a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from the beames of the Sunne. As the Sunne is manifeſted by his owne brightneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by his beames; for wee cannot ſee the Sunne <hi>in Rotâ,</hi> in his Charret, or circumvolution, but by his beames: ſo the inacceſſible Light of his Fathers glory is revealed <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam per radios ac ſplendorem,</hi> as it were by beames and brightneſſe ſhining moſt clearely in Chriſt: and the roote and Fountaine of that brightneſſe is in Chriſt's God-head, but darted upon us through the manhood: according to that teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29795:44"/>
is the place and ſeate of ſecrets: now it is Chriſt onely that opens the boſome, declares the ſecrets, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales the glory and brightneſſe of Gods face unto Beleevers: therefore hee muſt needs bee exceeding preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if wee conſider Chriſt in <label type="milestone">

The Apoſtle relates to the Paſchall Lamb, which was to be ſo conditioned: it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull, that Chriſt ſhould not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be man; but alſo a man perfectly holy and righteous; elſe he could not have been a competent and ſitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng Saviour: yea, he had been ſo farre from ſatisfying for the ſinnes of others, that he muſt have dyed for his owne. And beſides it was requiſite that there ſhould be that beautifull analogy and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between him that loſt all, and him that recover'd all; that as <hi>Adam,</hi> who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29795:45"/>
plaid the Bank-rupt, was perfect; ſo ſhould the Redeemer be. Chriſt indeed in a certaine place doth turne off from himſelfe the appellation of good in a ſenſe of perfection. One called him <hi>good Maſter:</hi> but he replyed, <hi>why calleſt thou mee good? there is none good but God, Matth.</hi> 19. 16, 17. But why doth Chriſt doe ſo? was not he perfectly good? yes: but the other was not ware of his God-head, when he cal'd him ſo: he looked upon Chriſt (ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome)</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as upon a meere naked, extenuated, debaſed man: and yet he attributes unto him a more then humane goodneſſe and perfection; according to the errour of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whoſe Diſciple, no doubt he was. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> held, that even men by a ſtrict obſervance of the Law might attaine to perfection of Righteouſneſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony in this life: and ſuch a thought, no queſtion, had this Schollar of theirs concerning Chriſt: ſo that if wee looke well upon it, we ſhall ſee, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not deny himſelfe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good: but onely he checks the phariſaicall opinion of perfection in thoſe, that are no more then men.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29795:45"/>
Chriſt was more then a meere man<hi>:</hi> if the young man had knowne ſo much<hi>:</hi> he ſhould not have been reproved for calling him <hi>good</hi> in a ſenſe of abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfection: ſuch an Epithite was rightly applyable unto Chriſt, had the young <hi>Phariſee</hi> been ware of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: or had he knowne the ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his conception, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; he might have ſaid of him, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth; <hi>thou art fairer then the children of men:</hi> and ſo the title of <hi>good Maſter</hi> would never have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt as man alſo was abaſed: and yet in his abaſement hee was very excellent: it is a very comely ſight to ſee a great Perſonage of a meek, humble and lowly carriage, willing to ſtoope, and to come downe from his height; ſo it be not in a ſordid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting way. Now ſo it was with Chriſt: he waſhed the very feet of his Diſciples: he became poore to make us rich: hee faſted, that we might feaſt: he went on foote, that wee might ride, as I may ſay<hi>:</hi> he died, that wee might live. The Apoſtle ſaith, that though he was in the forme of God, <hi>and thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:29795:46"/>
               <hi>or Sacriledge to be equall with God: yet he made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men: and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe, Philip,</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. Now marke, I pray, the antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or oppoſition, which theſe words hold forth.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was from all eternity <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſhape of men,</hi> that is in the very rank, nature and quality of men, ſubject to mans paſſions, and every way a right man, <hi>ſinne onely excepted,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you heard before. Againe, <hi>be thought it no rapine or robbery to be equall with God:</hi> yet he ſuffered himſelfe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded and rob'd of his glory by ſinfull
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29795:46"/>
men. God cal's him <hi>the man, that is his fellow, Zach.</hi> 13. 7. and yet he was made a fellow to theeves and malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours: yea he was made inferiour and underling to baſe men, a very murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer being preferred before him. Though he was full of glory and excellency: yet he did empty himſelfe of all: for ſo are the words of the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he evacuated or emptied himſelfe,</hi> that is, he reduced himſelfe, as it were to nothing; or (as a Father hath it) <hi>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted himſelfe;</hi> he drew himſelfe dry. Laſtly, though he was the Prince and Lord of life: yet <hi>he humbled himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death:</hi> and the baſeſt death of all, <hi>the death of the Croſſe:</hi> it was a Roman kinde of execution, and aſſerted even by a Romane Oratour to be of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt ignominious and ſhamefull. <hi>Civem Romanum ſcelus eſt verberare propè paricidium n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>care: quid dicam in crucem tollere?</hi> ſaid that Oratour. It is a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wickedneſſe to beate a Romane: it is almoſt paracide to kill him: what is it then to crucifie him? how beyond meaſure hainous is that? yet thus low was the Sonne of God brought. And it addes likewiſe to the meaſure of his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29795:47"/>
humility and lowlineſſe, that he was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in all this debaſement: he was not forced or compelled to it: <hi>no man taketh my life from me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but I lay it downe of my ſelfe, Joh.</hi> 10. 18. and what he ſaith of his life, is true alſo of all his Divine glory: it was not violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnatch't from him whither he would, or no: but he did willingly, cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpontaneouſly and of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord deveſt and ſtrip himſelfe of it. Now certainly thus to deſcend from Heaven to Earth, from Divinity to humanity, from a Kingdome to ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from life to death, and all this of his owne free and willing diſpoſition without any compulſion or enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this addes no little grace and luſter to him. 'tis a very ſeemly ſight to ſee a venerable perſon condeſcending, ſtooping low, and denying himſelfe; to ſee a King caſting aſide his Robes of Majeſty, and deſcending to a lower pitch for the doing of ſome good, which otherwiſe cannot be atcheived: we had been eternally loſt, if the Sunne of God had not done thus<hi>:</hi> unleſſe he had humbled himſelfe, wee could never have been exalted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:29795:47"/>
Thirdly, Chriſt as man was obedient unto the will of his Father: he was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally and conſtantly obedient: he was obedient without any the leaſt reluctation, grudging, or unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To this purpoſe makes that of the moſt excellent ſong, where it is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he cometh leaping upon the Mountaines, and skipping upon the hills, Cantic.</hi> 2. 8. there were great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of difficulties and hardſhip in the way of our Redemption; yet he paſt lightly and cheerefully over them all to doe the will of him that ſent him. Yea, he was ſo farre from grumbling and murmuring, that it was even meat and drinke to him to doe that will; and he was ſtraitned and pained in his mind till the bloudy baptiſme of his ſuffering was accompliſhed, <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 50. <hi>It is written of him in the rowle of Gods booke; Loe, I come to doe thy will, ô God:</hi> thoſe words, <hi>Loe, I come;</hi> ſhew his alacrity and cheerefulneſſe, his readineſſe and forwardneſſe to doe his Fathers will: his loynes were alwayes girded, and his feet ſhodde unto it. The Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in the Saints makes them to be prompt and ready unto all duties,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29795:48"/>
and workes commanded of God: how much more then was Chriſt himſelfe ſo, in whom the Spirit of God was, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Fountaine? when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered death, and the grave, and all the powers of darkneſſe for us, Repentance was hid from his eyes: he ſhrunke not, nor drew away the ſhoulder from it. Three times he was under ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite preſſure of Divine wrath, as had been enough to have cruſhed ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds, yet he flinched not; but dranke the bitter cup off to the very bottome: hee patiently <hi>endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Indeed it cannot be denyed, that when he was in his agony, he prayed to his Father to ſave him from that houre; and thrice he prayed, that the bitter cup might paſſe from him<hi>:</hi> yet he did not this through diſobedience or unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to undergoe the taske, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſet him to: but firſt of all we muſt know that his mind was ſo ſtricken with the infinite wrath of God, with which he was then confl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cting; ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and overwhelmed with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable preſſure; that all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of his ſoule were for a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29795:48"/>
while interrupted, ſuſpended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: ſo that he knew not well what to ſay, nor whether to turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: this appeares by his words, <hi>Job.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>Now is my ſoule troubled, and what ſhall I ſay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when he prayed ſo, wee muſt conceive, that as a man ſubject to frailties like us (yet without ſinne) he thought he had been utterly loſt and undone, if his Father ſhould not deliver him from that houre, and excuſe him from drinking of the cup. His ſenſe of dolour was ſo vehement, and he ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with it; that it wru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g from him a ſignification of Natures feares and relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance: yet all the while his holy, his pure, and unblemiſhed mind was throughly bent, and reſolved to goe through ſtitch with the worke, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever came of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ſee, that when he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Father ſave me from this houre,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and immediately ſubjoynes: <hi>but for this cauſe came I unto this houre: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorifie thy name:</hi> likewiſe when he prayed, that the Cup might paſſe from him: he deſires it no otherwiſe, then with condition of his Fathers will. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29795:49"/>
in that ruefull vociferation and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> wee ſee that he did not let goe his hold; but remembred to ſay, <hi>my God, my God:</hi> ſo that here was no diffidence, no ſinne, no diſobedience all this while.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, all this was ſo carried, and punctually related by the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> to ſhew us theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The exceeding atrocity and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A mirrour of Gods infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Nature really and truly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fulneſſe of his expiation and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The certainty of his Fathers good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards us; whereof wee are the leſſe to doubt, by how much the more we ſee that the eternall Sonne was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and made an abject for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſt as a man likewiſe was perfect in all graces. The Prophet tells that there ſhould come <hi>a Rod out of the ſtemme of Jeſſe, and a branch out of his rootes; and the Spirit of the Lord was to reſt upon him; the ſpirit of wiſdome, and</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29795:49"/>
               <hi>underſtanding; the ſpirit of Counſell, and of might; the ſpirit of Knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord, Eſa.</hi> 11. 12. yea, ſo eminent was the Lord Jeſus this way; that even at twelve yeares old, <hi>be ſate in the Sanadrim, diſputing with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and asking them queſtions.</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>God gave not the Spirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto him, Joh.</hi> 3. 34. that is, he did not beſtow it upon him imperfectly and <hi>in part</hi> onely: but fully and entirely: for meaſure is not oppoſed to infinite, as the <hi>Eutychians</hi> would have it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their opinion of Ubiquity: for they thought, that if the Spirit were given unto the Manhood of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably, then even the Manhood would be capable of Divine properties; and conſequently, the fleſh of Chriſt would be no where circumſcribed, but every where preſent: but I ſay, that meaſure in the place before mentioned is not oppoſed to that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unmeaſurable; but to that which is not whole, entire, and perfect<hi>:</hi> Chriſt in the gifts of the Spirit was not lame and imperfect; but <hi>omnibus ſuis numeris abſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> full and compleate, as <hi>Adam</hi> was before he fell: and yet farre
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29795:50"/>
excelling <hi>Adam:</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet in a mutable condition: but Chriſt is ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and abiding for ever; confirmed in grace like the Holy Angels of God: <hi>Yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi> In reſpect of vertue and the Faith of Beleevers even his manhoode, before it was in being, was cloathed with perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of grace, and ſo continueth for ever. Againe, <hi>Adam</hi> was a meere man and alone by himſelfe: but in Chriſt the humane nature was <hi>hypoſtatically</hi> un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted unto the Divine: and hence it comes topaſſe, that Chriſt, even as man, had a greater meaſure of knowledge and Revelations of grace and heavenly gifts, then ever <hi>Adam</hi> had. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that in Chriſt dwels all the fulneſſe of the God-head</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>bodily Col.</hi> 2. 9. that is, not by a naked and bare communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of vertue, as God is ſaid to dwell in his Saints; but by a ſubſtantiall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two Natures, Divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, the eternall Word and the Man, conſiſting of a ſoule and body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become one <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſubſiſtence. Now from this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and wonderfull union of the two Natures in Chriſt, there flowes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29795:50"/>
the Manhood a plenitude and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all Spirituall wiſdome and grace, ſuch as was never found in any meere man; no not in <hi>Adam,</hi> while he ſtood in his integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Now then to draw to a concluſion of this head. If Chriſt even according to his humanity were perfectly innocent and holy: if he were in his Divine celfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and highneſſe voluntarily debaſed: if he were exactly obedient in all things to his Fathers commands: and if he were compleate in all heavenly wiſdome and graces: then certainly even as he was man, he was of all other moſt precious, moſt lovely and deſirable.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto, that <hi>his fleſh never ſaw corruption;</hi> that it roſe againe from the grave, it being impoſſible for the bands of death to detaine it. Alſo as man he came of the race of Kings. As man he ſhall <hi>judge the world, Acts</hi> 17. 31. As man he was wonderfully <hi>borne of a Virgin;</hi> called therefore by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar name, <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which ſignifieth a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundine,</hi> or <hi>after-birth, Geneſ.</hi> 49. 10. the word comes <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which ſignifies <hi>tranquillum eſſe;</hi> intimating that Chriſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29795:51"/>
is he, who hath brought us peace and tranquility: and that he might be our Peace-maker, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be <hi>Shiloh,</hi> borne of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſeed of a woman, without the ſeed of a man. The Apoſtle expounds the name, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 4. where he ſaith of Chriſt, that he was made of a woman: not of a man and a woman both; but of a woman alone without a man.</p>
            <p>Againe, Chriſt as man was foretold by the Prophets, and by ſundry types; attended upon at his birth by holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: a peculiar Starre created for him. Chriſt as man was in one <hi>hypoſtaſis,</hi> or perſon with God, called therefore <hi>Ithiel, Proverb.</hi> 30. 1. a word <hi>(as Junius writes)</hi> compounded of three parts; as if one ſhould ſay; <hi>the ſtrong God with mee:</hi> the name comes all to one with <hi>Immanuel;</hi> and the Apoſtle expounds both, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. where he ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>that he was God manifeſt in the fleſh:</hi> and this he affirmeth alſo to be <hi>without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a great Myſtery,</hi> and a <hi>Myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe:</hi> In every Art and profeſſion there is a Myſtery: but this holds forth a Myſtery of Godlineſſe: for he that was <hi>Ithiel,</hi> God preſent in the fleſh to every
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29795:51"/>
faithfull and beleeving ſoule, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal,</hi> Almighty, able for all things: ſo that by theſe two names the faithfull are aſſured of their Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and eternall Salvation through the preſence and power of God: and this doubtleſſe is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a great Myſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore Chriſt as man was our Sacrifice and expiation: he was our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the price of our Redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. though I confeſſe that this price had its worth from the union of the two natures. Againe, Chriſt as man was <hi>conceived of the Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> Chriſt as man <hi>is aſcended into Heaven:</hi> Chriſt as man <hi>ſits at the right hand of God.</hi> Now all theſe things, and much more that might be brought, doe ſpeake Chriſt a very precious and excellent perſon, and that even according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and there alſo he ſhines forth moſt gloriouſly, and appeares to be the moſt peereleſſe and precious thing in the world.</p>

            <p>Chriſt is a Prophet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in way of eminency and excellency above all other Prophets: he was the Head of them all; and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of all, other Prophets were but Types and ſhadowes of this great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe was but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of him: <hi>a Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto mee ſaith</hi> Moſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 37. thoſe words, <hi>like unto me,</hi> doe plainly ſhew, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was at the beſt but an Image and a ſhadow of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty dayes before the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>the Law on Mount Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i; ſo did</hi> Chriſt before he began to preach the Goſpel</p>
            <p>God did more clearly and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly manifeſt himſelfe unto <hi>Moſes</hi> then unto other men: it is ſaid, <hi>that he ſpake unto him face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend, Exod.</hi> 33. 11. ſo did the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father more openly reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto Chriſt, then unto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>no man knoweth the Father ſave the</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:29795:53"/>
               <hi>ſonne, and he to whomſoever the Sonne will reveale him, Matth.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> became a <hi>Shepheard in the Land of Midian:</hi> ſo is Chriſt the Shepheard and <hi>overſeer of our ſoules,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes was faithfull in all Gods houſe,</hi> and ſo was Chriſt, but yet in a farre more excellent manner then <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>Moſes was faithfull as a ſervant, Chriſt as a ſonne over his owne houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was himſelfe a part of that houſe: but Chriſt was the builder of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> under God did inſtitute Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. It is ſaid, that the <hi>Fathers p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſed under the cloud, and through the Sea; and were all baptiſed unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud, and in the Sea:</hi> marke that phraſe, <hi>unto Moſes:</hi> they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed unto him, as unto the type, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of Chriſt: for Baptiſme is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the New Teſtament, and properly of Chriſt's Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo inſtituted the Paſſeover: ſo did Chriſt the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>As the Law was exhibited by <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo was the Goſpel, which brings grace and truth, free Redemption, and the accompliſhment of all types unto Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29795:54"/>
exhibited by Chriſt, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 17. Thus you ſee, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>eximious</hi> Prophet was no more then a ſhadow of Chriſt. And the like may be ſaid of all the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: it were no hard matter to ſhew how they did all of them in one thing, or other reſemble Chriſt, juſt as the lively picture of a man doth his perſon: as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> in their Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſembled the aſcention of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noah</hi> by his righteouſneſſe ſaving all the reſt that went into the Arke with him, ſhadowed Chriſt, who by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience ſaves all true Beleevers. Concerning the Prophet <hi>David</hi> it is ſaid, that even thoſe <hi>which ſate at his Table roſe up againſt him, Pſal.</hi> 41. 9. ſo did <hi>Judas</hi> againſt Chriſt, who <hi>dipt with him in the platter. David</hi> alſo was a man <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods owne heart:</hi> ſo was Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt flawe or failing; and what an evident type of Chriſt was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when a dead body roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine being <hi>caſt into his grave, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bis bones?</hi> a <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 21. This was not done by any Native or inherent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Prophet: but by that accident to foreinſtruct the faithfull concerning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29795:54"/>
the vertue of Chriſts fleſh, which riſing from the dead, ſhould likewiſe raiſe up our periſhed bodies, according to that, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>thy dead men ſhall live: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſing yee that dwell in the duſt: for thy dew is as the dew of herbes, and the Earth ſhall caſt out the dead.</hi> Againe, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> lying three dayes and three nights in the belly of a fiſh, was a ſigne of Chriſt lying ſo long in the grave. The Prophets were all of them types and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of Chriſt: even <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, then whom <hi>there aroſe not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prophet of all thoſe that are borne of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> even he, I ſay, was but Chriſts harbinger or fore-runner. Now then as ſubſtances doe farre excell ſhadowes, and Kings their <hi>Ante-ambulos</hi> or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers: ſo doth Chriſt farre excell all Prophets: they all of them were but ſhadowes and fore-runners to him</p>
            <p>Secondly, other Prophets could ſpeak only to the ears of men: but Chriſt ſpake, and ſtill ſpeaks to the heart: <hi>he hath the Key of</hi> David; <hi>he openeth, and no man ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; he ſhutteth and no manopeneth, Rev.</hi> 3. 7. it is a ſimilitude taken from them, that keep the Keys of a City, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29795:55"/>
without which they can neither be opened, nor ſhut: no more can any open the heart or breake in upon the Spirit, beſide Chriſt: he alone is able to open the eyes of the mind, and to convince the Conſcience, by the ſecret, kindly and powerfull working of his owne Spirit.</p>
            <p>Other Prophets can preach wiſdome unto men<hi>:</hi> but Chriſt can preach them wiſe: other Prophets can warne men by telling them of their ſinnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Judgements of God: but Chriſt can reclaime them, and turne them from their ſinnes: <hi>the dead heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and live, Joh.</hi> 5. 25. and hence it is ſaid, that <hi>he taught, as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes:</hi> it came coldly and driely from them: but full of pareſie and boldneſſe, full of conviction, and rae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, full of the <hi>evident demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes: in this manner came the word from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, other Prophets were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to ſearch out the mind of God: and they did it by way of act onely, the Divine will being revealed and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29795:55"/>
unto them, but the mind of God was in Chriſt habitually and radically: the fountaine and roote, the ſource and principall cauſe of Chriſt's Prophecie was in himſelfe. Before all time Chriſt had the honour to ſit in the ſeat of moſt excellent ſecrets; <hi>the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> and therefore he is able, as from himſelfe to reveale all the Oracles and ſecrets of God needfull to be knowne: he is able to reveale them when, and how, and to whom he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Now that theſe things are habitually in Chriſt, as heate in fire, or water in a living and ever-flowing ſpring, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by this.</p>
            <p>1. That Chriſt is eſſentially wiſdome and underſtanding: <hi>Counſell is mine, and ſound wiſdome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Prov.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
            <p>2. It appeares alſo by this, becauſe he counſels us to buy eye-ſalve of him, that wee may ſee; and becauſe he hath power to ſend the Spirit; ye have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the holy One, and yee know all things ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. Chriſt is the holy one from whom wee receive the anoynting of the Spirit, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our eyes and diſcovering unto us
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29795:56"/>
all ſaving truthes. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> 2. 3. They are hid in him, as Gold, and Silver are <hi>in ſuo loco,</hi> as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſpeakes, hid in the veines of the Earth: that's another Argument of the habitualneſſe of Prophecie in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and another is this, that <hi>all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is ſaid to <hi>dwell in him, Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 19. where by the terme of plenitude or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> underſtands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> gifts in a moſt copious and plentifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which he ſaith, that the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe call habituall grace, diſtinct from the grace of union; the union (he meanes) of the two natures. Now one part of this habituall grace and fulneſſe in Chriſt, is the gift of Prophecie: and marke, I pray; it is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit or dwell in Chriſt:</hi> this implyes the habitualneſſe of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, other Prophets could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale but ſome part of the will of God, and at ſometimes onely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>that God ſpake unto the Fathers by the Prophets at ſundry times, and in divers manners;</hi> that is, he did let out his Light <hi>minuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:29795:56"/>
by little, and little, till the day-Starre and Sunne of Righteouſneſſe a-roſe: but (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken by his Son, ver.</hi> 2. that is, he hath ſpoken more fully and plainely. The antitheſis or oppoſition which the Apoſtle ſets between Gods ſpeaking by the Prophets of old, and by his Sonne in this latter age of the world, ſhewes plainely the dimneſſe and darkneſſe of thoſe former ages in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>hoſe, which have been ſince the coming of Chriſt: in this reſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Apoſtle ſaith, that the heires of life and ſalvation were but <hi>children</hi> before Chriſt's incarnation, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 1, 2 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the generality of them they knew but as Children, for that we have done ſince, beſides other points of minority and non-age touching Legality and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which the Apoſtle in that place termes elements or rudiments of the world; and the State of the Saints under them a ſtate of bondage; as wee ſee now but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>through a glaſſe darkely,</hi> for what we ſhall doe in the life to come: all is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apt up in a riddle now, for what it will be then: ſo did they of old in compariſon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29795:57"/>
of us: their Light was but an obſcure and glimmering light to ours. Chriſt hath flowed in upon his people in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abundance of Revelation ſince his coming, then before: His diſcovery of himſelfe then was but <hi>a ſtanding behind the wall, a looking forth of the window, a ſhewing himſelfe through the Lattice,</hi> Cant. 2. 9.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, other Prophets might not preach themſelves<hi>:</hi> the Apoſtle inveighs againſt ſelfe-commenders, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>we dare not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome, that commend themſelves:</hi> and in another place he ſpeakes out plainly: <hi>no man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>liveth to himſelfe, Rom.</hi> 14. 7. that is, none ought to live unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Yea, even Chriſt himſelfe relating to himſelfe as a meere man, ſaith, <hi>that his witneſſe is not true, if he beare witneſſe of himſelfe; Joh.</hi> 5. 31. but in another place relating to himſelfe as Mediatour, as God and man in one perſon, and one with the Father, he ſpeakes cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this<hi>: though I doe beare record of my ſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet my record is true, Joh.</hi> 8. 14. Here then is a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between other Prophets in re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pect
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29795:57"/>
of their Office, and Chriſt: they might not preach themſelves: they did indeed report ſomething of their owne vertues, but it was for holy example and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſake; and it was ſtill with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the maine object of the word which was Chriſt. But now Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Mediatour, our great Prophet, <hi>the Apoſtle of our Profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Meſſenger of the Covenant</hi> between God and us, he may and doth preach himſelfe: <hi>to him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Acts</hi> 10. 43. and he beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of himſelfe, becauſe he hath not a greater in the point of our Juſtification, Sanctification, and eternall Salvation to beare witneſſe of, than himſelfe<hi>:</hi> and hence are thoſe ſelfe-predications of his, which wee finde in the Scriptures. <hi>Looke unto me, and be yee ſaved, all the ends of the Earth. Come unto me all yee that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and are heavie laden.</hi> When hee read that place of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he told the people, <hi>this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares.</hi> When the excommunicated man asked him who the Sonne of God was? he anſwered him, <hi>thou haſt both ſeen him, and it is he that talketh with thee:</hi> and he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29795:58"/>
told the Samaritaneſſe plainely, that he was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And it is ſaid of the two Diſciples, <hi>that beginning at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe.</hi> Now ſurely it commends unto us the Prophecie of Chriſt, that he might preach &amp; commend himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any blot of arrogancie, or taking too much upon him: this argues him to be a high and honourable Prophet above all other.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, all the Prophets had their Commiſſion and Authority from him: <hi>the words of the wiſe are as Goads, and as nailes faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which are given from one Shepheard,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>the words of the wiſe</hi> are Divine and heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions<hi>: the Maſters of Aſſemblies</hi> are Goſpel-Miniſters and Teachers: and Chriſt is that <hi>one Shepheard</hi> from whom thoſe words are given, and from whom thoſe Maſters have their Authority. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>that he went by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is, by his Divine vertue and power, <hi>and preached unto thoſe Spirits, that are now in priſon</hi> (in Hell wee muſt conceive) <hi>having been diſobedient unto the</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:29795:58"/>
               <hi>word of God, and deſpiſed his long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Arke was preparing,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. 20. here we ſee, that that, which <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher of righteouſneſſe did, is attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: becauſe <hi>Noah</hi> was but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, and had his Commiſſion from him; juſt as it is ſaid, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Priſoners did in the priſon, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was the doer of it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 39. 22. becauſe they did it by warrant and leave from him; or by his dictation and Commandement.</p>
            <p>Againe, obſerve that phraſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 46. <hi>drop thy word toward the South:</hi> and the like ſpeech is that of <hi>Moſes; my Doctrine ſhall droppe, as the raine; my words ſhall diſtill as the dew; as the ſmall raine upon the tender hearbe, and as the ſhowres upon the graſſe.</hi> Now from this phraſe <hi>of dropping,</hi> wee may draw an Argument, that Chriſt is the head of all true Prophets and Teachers. For look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as the cloudes, from whence the raine deſcends, have not their water originally and natively in themſelves; but from the Sea and moiſtned places of the Earth exhal'd and drawne up by the heat of the Sunne: ſo have not the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29795:59"/>
Prophets a Spirit of Propheſie; nor any Divine Teachers a faculty of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heavenly and ſaving Truths of themſelves<hi>:</hi> but it is drawne up out of Chriſt, as out of a full Sea of all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wiſdome and knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayed into them by the heat and vigour, not of their own Spirit, but a far higher ſpirit then theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Neither may other Prophets goe of their owne heads, but by Commiſſion and delegation from him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have the name of <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> given them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Ambaſſadours for Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt it is, that ſaid, <hi>goe and teach all nations.</hi> Chriſt it is, that inſtituted the Miniſtry of the word. Chriſt it is <hi>that gave ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome Evangeliſts and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. and hence are thoſe ſpeeches ſo frequent in the Old Teſtament: <hi>heare the word of the Lord, the mouth of the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it: the word of the Lord came unto me,</hi> and the like: in which places the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for Lord is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and by <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> is meant the ſecond perſon, to wit, the Lord Jeſus, the whole adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things for the good of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29795:59"/>
Church being committed unto him: and hither tends that remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>The Lord revealed himſelfe unto</hi> Samuel <hi>in Shiloh by the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Junius in Loc.</note> 
               <hi>word of the Lord;</hi> that is, by Jeſus Chriſt; who in the preceding bookes of the Scripture (as <hi>Junius</hi> notes) was wont to be called <hi>the Angel of the Lord:</hi> and afterward, as he revealed himſelfe more cleerely, he was called <hi>the word of the Lord.</hi> But beſides the opinion of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> another place of Scripture doth confirme this interpretation<hi>:</hi> the place is <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 19. 24. <hi>The Lord rained upon Sodome and Gomorrah brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven.</hi> From this Scripture I gather thus much<hi>:</hi> that as the ſecond perſon is brought forth act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by way of mediation from the firſt, in point of Rule and Kingdome here: ſo in that place of <hi>Samuel</hi> he is brought forth acting from him mediately in <hi>point</hi> of Prophecie: although I confeſſe that conſidered according to his God-head, he did both execute Judgments upon the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and reveale him-ſelf unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> immediately from himſelf, without any ſuch dependence or ſubordination.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, that Chriſt is the head
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29795:60"/>
and principall of all Prophets being in ſundry reſpects the moſt excellent this way of all other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider Chriſt as a Prieſt, and here alſo wee ſhall finde him to be moſt precious and excellent: here is the very heart and ſtrength of all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation between God and us; indeed in reſpect of our neceſſity, who muſt firſt know our owne miſery and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, before we can apply the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, and ſo be reduced to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience and ſubjection to the Kingdome of God; Prophecie hath the firſt place in the mediation of Chriſt; after which followes Prieſthood, and laſt of all royalty or government.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as the prieſtly Office conſiſteth mainly in ſuffering of death; whereunto we were obnoxious and lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſinne, and could not be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without it: it plainely appeares, that this Office hath the preheminence and upper hand, and that it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit (as I may ſay) and buy out the other two. The Prophecie of Chriſt could never have opened our eyes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could his Kingdome have ruled and ſwayed our hearts, unleſſe by his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29795:60"/>
Prieſthood he had dyed for us. <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>which thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were, and thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them mee; and they have kept thy word, Joh.</hi> 17. 6. Here wee ſee are ſome that have the name of God, that is, the Salvation of God manifeſted unto them: ſo that Chriſt becomes a Prophet to them to enlighten their eyes: they be ſuch alſo, as are ſubject and obedient to the Kingdome of Chriſt; and therefore they are ſaid to keep Gods word: but now who be theſe that are partakers of ſuch graces and choyce bleſſings, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Sanctification? verily they be ſuch as God <hi>gave unto his Sonne out of the world,</hi> as that Scripture ſpeaks. Now I muſt tell you that this gift of God is free and properly ſo called, if wee reſpect the love of God, and our ſelves that partake of it. But if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſt the Mediatour, ſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called a gift: for God gave his Elect unto Chriſt conditionally for a price, the price of his Life-bloud. and hence the Myſtery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is called a Covenant. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Covenant of Grace in reſpect of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29795:61"/>
God, who was pleaſed of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to find out ſuch a remedy for miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, and to yeild to it: and alſo in reſpect of true beleevers, who enjoy the benefit of: but yet in reſpect of Chriſt the Mediatour, it is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made upon termes and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to wit, his paſſion, his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>The Prieſthood then of Chriſt is the moſt noble part of all his Mediation: without this his Prophecie and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome could never take hold of us, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe us any good: they whom God gives unto his Sonne out of the world upon Covenant, upon tearmes of his ſuffering and dying; they onely have the name of his ſalvation manifeſted unto them, and they onely keepe his word: all others how neere ſoever they may ſeeeme to be unto the Kingdome of God, and to the marke of ſalvation; yet they fall ſhort of it. In the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood then of Chriſt, &amp; in that eſpecially lies the latitude and longitude, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity and ſublimity of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us: and in reſpect of this eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is the whole Myſtery of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt called <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>But now further to ſet forth the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and dignity of Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and his exceeding preciouſneſſe thereby, let us make a collation and compariſon between him and the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſts, thoſe of <hi>Aaron's</hi> order.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all in the Leviticall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there was a plurality of Prieſts; as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>it was lawfull for the Prieſts onely to eate of the ſhew-bread;</hi> and in the fifth verſe, <hi>that the Prieſts in the Temple doe profane the Sabbaoth, and are blameleſſe:</hi> though there were but one High-Prieſt: yet there were many inferiour ſacrificing Prieſts at once, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 6. But now Chriſt was a Prieſt alone: <hi>he by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone hath appeared to take away ſinne: he hath by himſelfe purged our ſinnes,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <hi>his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and hence it is, that he cries out in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; I, <hi>even I am the Lord; and beſide me there is no Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in the Leviticall Prieſthood there was a change, a ſucceſſion and a moveableneſſe, and hence it came to

from him to another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24. in the prieſthood of <hi>Aaron's</hi> order every Prieſt bare office but for his owne time: and they were ſubject to be put out for miſdemeanor, as wee ſee in <hi>Abiathar,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 26. yea, and the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was diſſolved at the death of Chriſt. But Chriſt himſelfe is a Prieſt for ever: he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us: his prieſthood continueth unto the end of the world; yea and the vertue of it infinitely beyond all time: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will have no ſucceſſour, or Vicar. Chriſts Prieſthood like <hi>Melchiſedec's</hi> came neither by Father or mother, as you heard: for he was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of which (the Apoſtle ſaith) there is no mention made as touching prieſthood, ſave onely that a King of <hi>Judah</hi> did once to his coſt uſurpe that Office; and againe, as wee read not of the moments of <hi>Melchiſedec's</hi> either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration or ceaſing; ſo was Chriſt ever from the beginning of the world a Prieſt, and ever ſhall be to the end, <hi>ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Leviticall prieſts offred dayly offerings oftentimes: <hi>the Prieſts went alwayes into the firſt Tabernacle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:29795:63"/>
               <hi>the ſervice of God, Heb.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>and the High-Prieſt entred into the holy place, viz.</hi> the inmoſt Tabernacle <hi>every yeare with bloud, ver.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt offred but one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once for ever<hi>: once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and he doth il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this Truth by a ſimile, and confirme it by an Argument. His ſimile is in thoſe words: <hi>as it is appointed unto men once to die; but after this the Judge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment: ſo Chriſt was once offred to beare the ſinnes of many: and unto them that looke for him ſhall bee appeare the ſecond time without ſinne unto Salvation, Heb.</hi> 9. 27, 28. the explication or unfolding of this ſimilitude take thus: as there is nothing interpoſed between the death of a man, and his eternall doome, or Judgement: nothing can either marre, or mend his eſtate: but as the tree falleth, ſo it ſhall lie, whether toward the North, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South, toward Heaven, or toward Hell: ſo between the death of Chriſt and his ſecond coming, there is no hilaſticall or expiatory ſacrifice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjected, either to adde perfection to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29795:63"/>
the firſt; or to ranſome thoſe that had contemned it: and to this lookes that Scripture, where it it is ſaid, <hi>if wee ſinne wilfully after that wee have received the Knowledge of the Truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> 10. 26. there is not a ſecond propitiatory ſacrifice to be expected: Chriſt ſhall appeare the ſecond time without ſinne, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſacrifices for ſinne. Men muſt lay hold of that one once offred, and not deſpiſe it not ſeeme to embrace it, and afterward caſt it away: for if they doe, there will never come a ſecond to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſuch an offence.</p>
            <p>The Argument, which the Apoſtle uſeth to prove that Chriſts ſacrifice is but one, and once offred, is taken from the perfection thereof; wherein it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers much from the ſacrifices of the Law: for <hi>they could not make the comers unto them perfect,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. but there was in them an anniverſary or <hi>yearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſinnes:</hi> yea there was a daily repetition of ſome of thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as the Apoſtle mindeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11. ſo that here was no perfection: the Conſcience of the worſhippers might
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29795:64"/>
remaine for ever uncleane, for any thing that theſe ſacrifices could doe to purge them. But the ſingle and one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt, whereby he offred up himſelfe a <hi>Lambe without ſpot unto God,</hi> is of ſufficiency and perfectly able to doe away the ſinnes of all the elect in all ages and times of the world, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after converſion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, other prieſts and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were but types and ſhadowes of good things to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. and ſo likewiſe was the Tabernacle, and all the utenſiles thereof, in and by which they officiated, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 9.

            <p>Fifthly, other Prieſts entred onely into that place which was typically ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>the Tabernacle was a figure for the time then preſent, Heb.</hi> 9. 8, 9. it was made with hands; and therefore it is called <note n="a" place="margin">To <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>a worldly Sanctuary:</hi> but Chriſt is entred into that place, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly holy: <hi>he is entred into Heaven it ſelfe, now to appeare in the preſence of God for us: Heb.</hi> 9. 24. and hence he is ſaid to be a <hi>Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</hi> Now from the typicalneſſe of that Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the verity and ſubſtantialneſſe of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, wherein Chriſt our High-Prieſt offred, wee are taught, that if men in theſe <hi>times of Reformation,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. if in theſe times of more cleare Evangelick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſince the coming and ſuffering of Chriſt; if in theſe times, wherein the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29795:65"/>
Church of God hath put off her mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and childhood, and is come to be adult, as we ſay; is come to maturity and rifeneſſe of age: if, I ſay, men in theſe times having the Goſpel clearely and lightſomely preached unto them, will nevertheleſſe cleave in any meaſure to Judaicall rites and Ceremonies: if they will embrace ſhadowes, now the ſubſtance is long ſince come; then truly they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> (as we ſpeake) bar'd off from all benefit by Chriſt: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle: <hi>Wee have an Altar</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whereof they have no Right to eate, which ſerve the Tabernacle, Heb.</hi> 13. 10. If men will judaize and ſtick now to Moſaicall rudiments, they have no right to eate of the Chriſtians Altar, that is, they have no part nor portion in Chriſt. Such another ſentence we have, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Behold, I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, that if you be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing: for I teſtifie againe to every man, that is circumciſed, that he is a debtor to doe the whole Law: Chriſt is become of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto you, whoſoever of you is juſtified by the Law: yee are fallen from grace.</hi> That which is here ſaid of circumciſion, is true of all other Leviticall rites: if wee
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29795:65"/>
will retaine any of them, Chriſt will not profit us: wee are bound to keep the whole law: if wee obſerve a peice, wee muſt obſerve all: and if wee be juſtified by ſuch legall obſervances; Chriſt avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us nothing: wee hold not the head, when wee cleave to ſuch ordinances.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, other prieſts were to offer <hi>firſt for themſelves, and afterward for the people: Heb.</hi> 7. 27. This was the injunction of the Law: <hi>if the prieſt that is anointed doe ſinne according to the ſinne of the people; then let him bring for his ſinne, that he hath ſinned, a young bullock without blemiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord for a ſinne-offering, Levit.</hi> 4. 3. and in the 8. chapter of that booke wee reade, how that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were to offer <hi>a ſinne-offering</hi> at their conſecration; we muſt underſtand for themſelves. But it was not ſo with our High-Prieſt, the Lord Jeſus: hee offred for his people onely: as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he needed no ſacrifice<hi>: after three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and two weekes ſhall Meſſiah be cut off; but not for himſelfe, Dan.</hi> 9. 26. not for his owne tranſgreſſion: the Prince of this world came and tempted him: but could find no corruption in him, no yeilding to his tentations in the leaſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29795:66"/>
meaſure: <hi>he knew no ſinne, neither was there any guile found in his mouth: and it became us, that is, it was neceſſary and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull for us, to have ſuch an High-prieſt, as was holy, harmeleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, Heb.</hi> 7. 26. holy towards God, harmeleſſe towards men, undefiled in himſelfe, and totally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners, not contaminated or ſpotted with ſinne in the leaſt meaſure.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, conſider this, that Chriſt is the moſt mercifull, the moſt pitifull, and the moſt compaſſionate High-prieſt, that ever was: and therefore it was, that hee was made like unto us, bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, ſubject to hunger, thirſt, cold, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, tentation, and the like, as we are. The Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. ſaith, that this was <hi>behoofefull:</hi> he ſaith there, that he <note n="*" place="margin">

Chriſt our High-prieſt was more ſenſible and feeling of our affliction then ſo. <hi>We have not an High-prieſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like as we are; yet without ſinne, Heb.</hi> 4. 15. as it is ſaid, <hi>that never any man ſpake, as he ſpake:</hi> ſo I may ſay, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there any Prieſt, ſo milde, ſo gentle, ſo gracious, ſo loving, ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affectionate, and ſo regardfull of our condition, as Chriſt was: full to this purpoſe is that place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them: in his love and in his pitie he redeemed them: and he bare them and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> And againe: <hi>he ſhall feed his flock like a Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the Law wee read, that the High-prieſt was to beare the names of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his pectorall or breſt-plate upon his heart; now this did figure and ſhadow unto us the tender love and pitie that Chriſt the Mediatour beares to his people: guiding the blinde, feeding the hungrie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the comfortleſſe, reſtoring ſuch as are out of joynt: all is mercy, and love, and ſweetneſſe, and more then motherly affection that comes from him. All theſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt, as Mediatour: and hence it is that he hath the title <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>one of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commiſerations, Jam.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>In the eight and laſt place I ſhall tell you of a wonder. Chriſt unlike to all other Sacrificers was both the Prieſt, the Temple or Tabernacle, the Altar, and the Sacrifice all in one perſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he was a Prieſt in reſpect of both natures; which will eaſily be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29795:67"/>
if wee conſider the nature of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, or Umpire, who ought to be one indifferent, and equally inclining to either party, like a paire of ſcales that hang even; neither ſide lift up, or depreſſed more than the other. A medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour is not of one, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 20. ſo did Chriſt indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partake of both natures, Godhead, and Manhood; that ſo he might be fit to ſtand in the gap between his Father and us. We muſt beleeve therefore, that whole Chriſt offred up himſelfe unto God; even the Manhood, as well as the Godhead, did offer it ſelfe: Chriſt is a Prieſt according to both natures. And whereas it is ſaid, that hee offred himſelfe through the eternall Spirit without ſpot unto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. that doth not put the manhood from its ſhare in prieſthood: but onely it ſhewes how the Sacrifice came to be <hi>without ſpot or blemiſh,</hi> namely by the hypoſtaticall union of the two natures, the eternall Spirit, that is, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt aſſuming the fleſh into one perſon with it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt was the Tabernacle or Temple moſt properly according to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29795:68"/>
his God-head: for he ſaith himſelfe in the Goſpel, that <hi>the Gold of the Temple is ſanctified by the Temple it ſelfe:</hi> ſo is the manhood ſanctified and made noble by the God-head. Nevertheleſſe in ſome reſpects his humane body was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo: <hi>Deſtroy this Temple</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I will build it againe in three dayes,</hi> he ſpeakes it of his body, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Temple not onely becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit dwelt in it after a ſingular and peculiar way, conceiving it at the firſt, and ſanctifying it perfectly; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the offring of it up, God found in it an acceptable ſacrifice, and ſmelt in it a ſweet favour as in a Temple. But yet further to this purpoſe: the fleſh of Chriſt is called a <hi>vaile, Heb.</hi> 10. 20. in which the Apoſtle alludes to the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or vaile in the Tabernacle of old, and in the Temple, by which alone there was entrance into the holieſt place of all; ſo by the vaile of his fleſh, rent and torne upon the Croſſe, hath Chriſt opened a new and a living way for us to paſſe to God, and to Heaven. Thus is he the Tabernacle or Temple accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both natures too.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is the Altar moſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29795:68"/>
properly according to his Divinity: for he ſaith himſelfe, that <hi>the Altar doth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Gift, Matth.</hi> 23. 19. And thus doth the God-head like an Altar ſanctifie the Manhood, as a gift or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, making it of infinite merit, and and worth with God the Father: the Altar ought to be of greater dignity then the oblation. But now although the God-head of Chriſt alone be the ſanctifying, and dignifying thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the offering of himſelfe, that is, of his fleſh unto God: yet in reſpect of his preſenting us blameleſſe and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as it were, without ſpot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh unto his father, ſo whole Chriſt, God and man in one perſon is the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Altar, that makes us accepted with God. The Scripture it ſelfe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. 6, 7. God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>that he will bring even the ſonnes of the ſtranger</hi> (that is, the Gentiles) <hi>to his holy Mountaine, and make them joyfull in his houſe of Prayer, and their burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, and their ſacrifices ſhall be accepted upon his Altar:</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>mine houſe ſhall be called an houſe of Prayer for all people:</hi> in which place by the Altar we are to underſtand whole Chriſt, God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29795:69"/>
and man, the bleſſed Mediatour, upon whom, as upon an Altar, all Nations promiſcuouſly, both Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, were an offering acceptable to God. And a like place there is in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. 7. <hi>All the flocks of Kedar ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together unto thee; the Rammes of Nebaioth ſhall miniſter unto thee; they ſhall come up with acceptance on mine Altar, and I will glorifie the houſe of my glory.</hi> Here alſo whole Chriſt is the Altar, that makes the Gentiles to be (as I may ſay) a ſacrifice of a ſweet-ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto God. To this alſo tends that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6. 7. where <hi>a coale from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar touching the Prophets lips, his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is taken away, and his ſinne purged:</hi> now what is it that taketh away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Lamb? what is it that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſinne, but the bloud of Chriſt? although I grant (as before) that if wee reſpect the offring of himſelfe, the body and bloud of Chriſt was moſt properly the ſacrifice. I will adde a few words more touching this matter out of Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> upon <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9. he ſaith, that the ſoules under the Altar are moſt eminently the Martyrs, whoſe ſalvation is placed onely in the death
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29795:69"/>
of Chriſt; under which thoſe holy Champions lying hid, as under a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, they might ſafely and without ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour appeare before God: now it is true, that this death of Chriſt in reſpect of himſelfe was the ſacrifice: but to the Martyrs, and to all the Saints, it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his God-head as an Altar, under which (and not under their own perpeſſions and ſuffrings as any whit meritorious) they lie ſafe and ſecure.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is moſt properly the ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. yet for as much as whole Chriſt preſents himſelfe now in the ſight of God for us: wee are to judge that whole Chriſt, God and man was after a ſort the oblation or offring; and hence the bloud thereof is ſaid to be <hi>the bloud of God, Acts</hi> 20 28. Nevertheleſſe though in reſpect of us, who are reconciled, juſtifyed, ſanctifyed and eternally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereby, whole Chriſt is offred up: yet let us be wiſe unto ſobriety: Let us (as I may ſay) give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods, that is, let us give unto each nature of Chriſt its owne properties and offices: both his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29795:70"/>
Deity and his humanity did diſtinctly act their parts: his humanity by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring the puniſhment due to us, and by fulfilling all righteouſneſſe<hi>:</hi> and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity by conferring upon thoſe ſuffering infinite and ſaving vertue. The humane ſoule and fleſh of Chriſt was the <hi>holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſto,</hi> or whole burnt-offring roſted it the fire of his Fathers wrath, his God head was the Temple in which, and the Altar upon which this ſacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred; and laſtly, Chriſt both God and man, was the Prieſt moſt willingly and cheerefully officiating in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unlike unto all other Prieſts was himſelf both the Prieſt, and the Sacrifice, and the Temple, and the Altar all in one perſon; and in ſome reſpects alſo all according to both natures: ſo that wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may he be called <hi>wonderfull,</hi> as we read of him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6. and well alſo may the Apoſtle ſay, that the <hi>Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is without controverſie a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then to conclude this diſcourſe of Chriſts Prieſthood: if he were a Prieſt alone; an everlaſting Prieſt, a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29795:70"/>
Prieſt offering but once, and yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for ever; the ſubſtance and verity of all thoſe Prieſts, which went before him; gone into heaven, which never any did as Prieſts, but he onely; not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to offer for himſelfe, but onely for us; a moſt mercifull and pitifull high Prieſt: and laſtly, ſacrifice, Temple, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and Prieſt, all in one: if Chriſt, I ſay, be ſuch an high Prieſt, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt needs grant him even by this argument to be very precious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider Chriſt as a King: and in this alſo his glory, his dignitie, and his excellency ſhines forth moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently. Chriſt is a King above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, his Kingdome is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Kingdome: he rules over the ſoules and conſciences of men: other Kings may ſubject the bodies and the eſtates of ſuch as are under them; but not their conſciences. Indeed there hath been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation in this kinde; but never tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and allowed by Chriſt. One and the chiefeſt of all <hi>Babylons</hi> merchandize are <hi>the ſoules of men,</hi> Revel. 18. 13. by her curſes, excommunications, pardons, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29795:71"/>
and the like inventions, ſhee hath made merchandize of the ſoules, and domineer'd over the conſciences of men. Epiſcopacy in all places more or leſſe hath trodden in the ſame path; let the Reformiſts of theſe times have a care, that nothing be obtruded and thruſt upon tender conſciences, which they cannot beare: the heart, the ſoule, and the conſcience, is properly the ſubject of Chriſts Kingdome: neither will he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſubjection thereof to any other then himſelfe: domination and lordſhip over the ſoule, is a part of his glory, which he will not give to another. The Church ſpeaks it with indignation, <hi>that her own mothers ſonnes,</hi> ſuch as ſeemed to be of her numbers and corporation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed with rage againſt her, <hi>made her the keeper of other vines, and to neglect her own;</hi> that is, they forced her to ſerve in part their phanſies and pleaſures <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Fenner</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon the place, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delburgh,</hi> 1587.</note>, while ſhee abated of her diligence in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe duties, which God required of her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6. God challengeth the perſons of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, neither muſt they be ſold as bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: becauſe <hi>he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,</hi> Levit. 25. 42. Now the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29795:71"/>
like reaſon doth the Apoſtle give why wee ſhould not ſubject our hearts and conſciences to the ordinances of men in matters of religion: <hi>yee are bought with a price,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be not yee the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7 23. that is, doe not man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate and enſlave your conſciences to any humane deviſe in matters meerely ſpirituall. Chriſt alone is the King and Lord of our ſpirits: his Kingdome is ſpirituall; his Lawes are ſpirituall; his people are ſpirituall; he rules in the Kingdomes of men, and meddles in their ſecular affaires all in order to his own ſpirituall Kingdome; Heatheniſh people have been tamed and civiliz'd, that way might be made for their embracing of the Goſpel. All the warres of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all their policies, and governments, all their riſings and decayings, all the great works that ever were done in the world, have tended by degrees at leaſt to the advancement of Chriſts ſpirituall Kingdome: Chriſt hath ſtill made them his prudentialls to bring about his own ends. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> firſt ſubdued the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; after him the <hi>Babylonian;</hi> then the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and the <hi>Grecian</hi> followed him; but the <hi>Roman</hi> went farther then
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29795:72"/>
them all: and when God had thus ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the earth, and the Kingdomes of the world, then it was high time for Chriſt the deſire of all Nations to come, and the Goſpel to be more clearly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, then before. I ſpeake this to ſhew, how that Chriſt mingles himſelfe even in worldly agitations and affaires, that thereby he may further and ſet forward his own ſpirituall Kingdome, and it ſhould teach us to rule and ſteere our courſe in ſuch things not carnally and groſsly, as the Heathen doe, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as Chriſt doth; his Kingdome i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a ſpirituall Kingdome; ſo he tells <hi>Pilate: My kingdome;</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not of this world,</hi> Joh. 18. 36. that is (ſaith Mr. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> he reigneth not according to the fleſh, and the world; but he ruleth and ſanctifieth in ſpirituall and heavenly things, as righteouſneſſe, truth, wiſdome, peace, ſalvation: not as though all things of this world, and even of Hell it ſelfe were not alſo in ſubjection unto him (otherwiſe how could he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſerve us and defend us from them all?) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Kingdome doth not conſiſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them, or of them. Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is in heavenly &amp; ſpirituall things,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29795:72"/>
as in binding and looſing of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, captivating the affections, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the heart, in obedience to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo bringing us by degrees unto glory. There be them, that tell us of a Monarchicall Kingdome of Chriſt, whereby he ſhall in proper perſon reigne a thouſand yeares upon the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end and conſummation of the world; which if it be a truth, yet I leave the opinion thereof to be ſcan'd and diſputed of by the judicious. Truth and falſhood are brought to light by travaile, induſtry, and diſputation: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed,</hi> Dan. 12. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Kingdome of Chriſt according to his Mediatorſhip is a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Univerſall it is in reſpect of all Nations; <hi>There was given him dominion, and glory, and a Kingdome, that all people, and Nations, and languages, ſhould ſerve him,</hi> Dan. 7. 14. <hi>The heathen are bis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the ends of the earth his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi> The Monarchs of the world have <note place="margin">Pſa. 2. 8.</note> ſtretched their Empiers farre: <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars</hi> Kingdome in <hi>Strabo</hi> reached as farre as <hi>Spain,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> delivers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29795:73"/>
out of that Author; The <hi>Perſians</hi> pierced farther; <hi>Alexander</hi> farther then they; and the <hi>Romans</hi> farther then them all: but none of all theſe ſubdued the whole habitable, as Chriſt hath done, his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have been, and are to be gathered from the foure winds all over the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>That their ſound went into all the earth, &amp; their words unto the ends of the world,</hi> Rom. 10. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts Kingdome is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall in reſpect of all ſorts, ranckes, and conditions of men <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was a ſhadow of the Church: Now as into that Arke came creatures of every kindes ſo into the Church, which is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, are received people of all ages, ſexes, profeſſions and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever: if their conditions be ſuch as thwart the laws and ordinances of that Kingdome, they are laid downe, they are changed in the very act of their reception. This Kingdome doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any, that will ſubmit to it: but all ſorts of people may come and be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This is elegantly ſet forth by the Prophet, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41. 19. where God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>to plant in the Wilderneſſe the Cedar,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:29795:73"/>
               <hi>the Sitath tree, the Myrtle, the Oyle-tree, the Firre-tree, the Pine, and the Box-tree together.</hi> This alſo is ſignified by the Net caſt into the Sea, which <hi>gathereth fiſh of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>every kinde,</hi> and ſo alſo of every kinde are reſerved as good: this net is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of the Goſpel preached, &amp; called the kingdome of heaven, becauſe it doth forme, promove and advance that Kingdome. The fiſh of every ſort, which the net catches, doe declare that people of all qualities are admittable into the Kingdome of Chriſt. This likewiſe was ſweetly repreſented unto <hi>Peter</hi> by a ſheet knit at the foure corners, <hi>wherein were all manner of foure-footed beaſts,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 10. 12.</note> 
               <hi>of the Earth, and wild Beaſts, and creeping things, and foules of the aire;</hi> and the Apoſtle was bid <hi>to ariſe, and to ſlay and eate.</hi> Now by this he was taught, that not onely the Gentiles, as well as the Jewes were to be received into the Kingdome of Chriſt: but alſo <hi>that in every Nation</hi> (as himſelfe afterwards expounds it) <hi>He that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſſe is accepted with him, Acts</hi> 10, 35. Let him be of what trade and occuptation, of what ranke and quality, of what ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29795:74"/>
ſoever he will be, Chriſt will not refuſe him coming unto him and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto the Scepter of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Kingdome of Chriſt is univerſall in reſpect of the ages and times of the world: it runnes through all ages, and it laſts from generation to generation. And hence it is, that Chriſt is called <hi>a King immortall,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. having ſpoken of the long ſuffering of Jeſus Chriſt, toward him in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent verſe, he addes immediately; <hi>now unto the King eternall, immortall, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the onely wiſe God be honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever and ever, amen:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt then is that God and King: and he is called <hi>immortall</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from all other Kings. The Kings of the world are mortall, they die, and leave their Kingdomes to others: but Chriſt is an immortall King, hee never dieth: his Kingdome knowes no period: it paſſes through all Epoches and tracts of time. Precious is Chriſt, that hath ſuch a Kingdome; and happie are his Saints, that have ſuch a King. When friends die; when Eſtates are gone; when the Sword rages; when ſickneſſe and death
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29795:74"/>
comes; when any trouble or affliction is upon them; yet to their unſpeakable comfort they know, that their mighty King liveth and reigneth; and ſo long as he is up, they cannot be ſo downe, but they ſhall riſe againe. Chriſt is a King in all ages of the world from the beginning: <hi>God is my King of old</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 12. and Chriſt is God there ſpoken of, as appeares by the words that follow: <hi>God is my King of old, working ſalvation in the midſt of the Earth;</hi> it is Chriſt the Mediatour, that workes ſalvation in the midſt of the Earth: for the Father hath committed all Judgement unto him; he then is King of old, from the very firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the world; and ſo ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be while the Sunne and Moone indure, as 'tis prophecied of him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſts Kingdome is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall in reſpect of all Creatures: <hi>all power is given into him both in heaven and in earth.</hi> In reſpect of his providence the creatures are ſubject to him as God: but as they ſerve to further the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his elect, and to beautifie his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: ſo they are ſubject unto him as Mediatour. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. It is ſaid of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29795:75"/>
Chriſt, <hi>that the Father hath put all things under his feet, and hath given him to be the head over all things to the Church:</hi> that is, ſo farre forth as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the good of the Church, ſo they are under the Kingdome of Chriſt as Mediatour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt rules as King alone: he alone is <hi>caput Eccleſiae,</hi> the head of the Church. When the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was growne vaſt and unweldy, there were colleagues in government, two men of equall Authority, one to rule the Eaſt, and another to ſway the Weſt. And in ſome places during the minority of the King they choſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, who hath Kingly Authority, and is <hi>pro tempore</hi> as a King. But it is not ſo in the Kingdome of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> he rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without a partner. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num non ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Regnum duos</hi> is a moſt true ſaying here, this one Kingdome will not beare two Kings at once. Ridiculous is the Popes challenge to be the Miniſteriall head of the Church<hi>:</hi> Chriſt rules alone without any ſuch Image of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he rules alone as head without either colleague in the largeneſſe of his dominion, or Regent in his minority,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29795:75"/>
ſole, or Vice-Roy in his abſence: hee hath indeed Officers, that rule under him: but the headſhip and royalty he reſerves as peculiar to himſelfe; he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the government upon his owne ſhoulders, as wee reade, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6. he alone hath ſoveraigne power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in governing of his Church: he alone hath ſupremacy of Regiment<hi>:</hi> he alone is Claviger, the Key-carrier to his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 22. It is written thus of <hi>Eliakim: the Key of the houſe of</hi> David <hi>will</hi> I <hi>lay upon his ſhoulder: ſo he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut; and he ſhall ſhut, and none ſhall open:</hi> Now herein was this Saint a lively figure and type of Chriſt: the words of the Prophecie are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, in his advertiſement to <hi>Philadelphia, Revel.</hi> 3. and the ſenſe is this: that looke as <hi>Eliakim</hi> was made Steward, or Treaſurer under <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that is, the next unto the King in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all over the Land, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to forbid, to permit, to reward, to puniſh, to doe Juſtice, and to repreſſe all diſorder, of which Authority the bearing of a Key on the ſhoulder was a badge: ſo Chriſt as Mediatour under his Father hath regall power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29795:76"/>
over his Church; where hee commands in chiefe, as I may ſay; and no man may lift up his hand, or foote without him: he hath the Key of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> upon his ſhoulder, to preſcribe, to inhibit, to call, to harden, to ſave, and to deſtroy at his pleaſure; ſuch a Monarch and King is Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Church; neither hath any, ſuch rule and ſoveraignty beſide him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is an eternall and everlaſting King: he receives a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>that cannot be ſhaken;</hi> there ſhall be no end of it: his Throne endureth for ever. God rent away the Kingdome from <hi>Soul</hi> and others; and <hi>Mene, Mene,</hi> was upon <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> Kingdome, a full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umbring and finiſhing the dayes of it: but Chriſts Kingdome is everlaſting, and ſhall never expire; let the enemies thereof uſe what art and craft they will; they ſhall never deſtroy it, or pluck it up. <hi>The God of Heaven</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ſhall ſet up a Kingdome; which ſhall never be deſtroyed; neither ſhall it be left to other people: but it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Dan. 2. 44. If that of the Apoſtle be objected, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to God, even the Father,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:29795:76"/>
1 Cor. 15. 24. I anſwer, that this doth nothing at all impeach the everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts Kingdome: for the meaning of it is this: that at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reſurrection, and the end of the world, Chriſt ſhall lay downe his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, and ſhall deliver up all his Elect and faithfull Members, of whom now his Kingdome conſiſts, unto his Father, to be eternally crowned and glorifyed: and this ſhall be then, when hee ſhall have reconciled ſome of his Enemies, ſpoyled deſperate ones of their abuſed rule, power and authority, and quite aboliſhed death, the laſt Enemie<hi>:</hi> ſo that then Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to reigne any longer as Mediatour: he ſhall then ceaſe to reigne according to the preſent diſpenſation, and adminiſtring of his Office: but not as one God co-eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the Father: for his Kingdome according to his God-head ſhall then be compleate, conſummate and perfect: yea and his humanity alſo ſhall reigne then not as by, or of it ſelfe, but as joyned in one perſon with his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and as the common head of all thoſe, whom he hath redeemed, and ſanctified and brought toglory through
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29795:77"/>
taking their nature upon him, and ſuffering in it. So that the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned place in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> doth not ſpeake of the aboliſhing of Chriſts Kingdome; but of the perfection of it rather, when God, whoſe glory is now much obſcured and darkned by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhall be all in all among his Saints; and the eternall Father ſhall triumph eternally in his Sonne as a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Conquerour.</p>
            <p>The like anſwer alſo muſt be given to the objection, which may bee made from the words of the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. where he ſaith, <hi>that the Sonne alſo himſelfe ſhall be ſubject unto him, that did put all things under him.</hi> Theſe words are not ſo to be underſtood, as if the Father were not for the preſent well pleaſed with the Sonne, or as if the Sonne were not already ſubject to the Father, as Mediatour: but the meaning of them is this: that when all things, which doe now during the preſent forme of his adminiſtration make op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and reſiſtance againſt Chriſt, ſhall bee ſubdued unto him, and brought under his feet; then Chriſt himſelfe alſo, as touching his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29795:77"/>
ſhall be ſubject unto the Father, and God ſhall be all in all; neither doth this ſubjection imply a depreſſing, or pulling downe lower: but rather Chriſt and his Saints ſhall be at the height and top of their glory, when they ſhall be ſo ſubject; as on the other ſide whoſoever ſhall not then be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they ſhall be at the bottome of all remedileſſe miſery and wretchedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Before I paſſe away to another head, I muſt needs touch againe upon a place of Scripture before cited, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Now unto the King eternall, immortall, inviſible, &amp;c.</hi> Here be two words that doe expreſſe the perpetuity and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting duration of Chriſts Kingdome, <hi>eternall, and immortall,</hi> and neither of them is idle or ſuperfluous: the Holy Ghoſt doth not uſe tautalogie or vaine repetition in them. I have ſhewed you already what is meant by <hi>immortall,</hi> namely that the Kingdome of Chriſt is not ſubject to ſucceſſion; it is not liable to be devolved and rould downe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comers; which <hi>Daniel</hi> expreſſeth thus; <hi>his Kingdome ſhall not be left unto other people,</hi> as the Monarchies of the <hi>Babylonians, Medes, Alexander,</hi> and the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29795:78"/>
Kingdomes of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> which the Prophet had ſpoken of were; they were tranſlated from Nation to Nation, and from man to man, and at laſt quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. But Chriſts Kingdome ſhall not be pluck't up for others beſide himſelfe; but it ſhall hold on conſtantly through all ages and centuries of the world unto the end: and when the end com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, it ſhall not expire and give up the Ghoſt; but it ſhall attaine to its full beauty and perfection; it ſhall come to its meridian, or verticall point, as I may ſay, and ſhall never decline, never decay: it ſhall laſt beyond the world, and beyond all time for ever: therefore the Apoſtle calls Chriſt not onely an <hi>immortall King,</hi> but alſo an <hi>eternall King.</hi> Thus you ſee, that the Spirit of God doth to good purpoſe uſe two words, ſomewhat of kinne i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication one to the other; that thereby hee might ſet forth the excellency of Chriſts Kingdome above all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: by the one word is ſhewed the courſe of his Kingdome, through this world, during the time of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourſhip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and by the other word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the laſting of it unto all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29795:78"/>
after his Mediatorſhip is laid downe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is matchleſſe and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent above all other Kings in all Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertues, endowments, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he is a moſt ſapient and wiſe King, called therefore <hi>Counſellour</hi> by the Prophet, and <hi>onely wiſe,</hi> by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, the <hi>wonderfull Numberer;</hi> he that ſealeth up the ſumme, full of wiſdome: none eſſentially wiſe, but he: none but are depending and beholding for their wiſedome, but he, his fooliſhneſſe is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then men: they be all doters to him. Earthly Kings have their Counſellours; but he needs none<hi>: Solomon</hi> was the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt among them: but a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> is here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is <hi>Rex armipotens, &amp; bellicoſus,</hi> a moſt puiſſant and warlike King; called therefore <hi>a man of Warre, the Lord of Hoſts, the Captaine of our Salvation: the armies in Heaven,</hi> Angels and righteous men <hi>follow him;</hi> he is the <hi>ſtone cut out of the Mountaine without hands,</hi> ſent from heaven, and acting by no humane, but meerely Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>which ſmote the Image and brake</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:29795:79"/>
               <hi>in pieces the iron, the braſſe, the clay, the Silver and the Gold;</hi> the great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and Kingdomes of the world, to make way for his owne Kingdome: he is terrible to all the Kings of the Earth that withſtand him, he is ſo mighty and ſo politick, that he gets ground of his enemies by giving ground to them. The world, Hell, Death, ſinne, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the brethren, the enmity of the carnall mind, all theſe are in the Trophes of his victories. All his foes are and ſhall be made his footſtoole: he will make even the proudeſt of them to ſtoope and to hold his ſtirrup: yea he will make them his very ſtirrup to get on horſe-back by, as once <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>por</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> ſerved <hi>Valerian</hi> the <hi>Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is as eminent in peace alſo, as he is in warre; called therefore <hi>the Prince of Peace.</hi> When hee was borne, warres were huſht every where, and all the world was at peace. <hi>Jacob</hi> beheld him as a ladder reaching from Earth to Heaven, and what was this, but the Image of a Peace-maker between God and man? <hi>the Angels of God aſcended and deſcended by that ladder,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:29795:79"/>
ſignifying, that by Chriſt wee have the benefit of the Miniſtry of Angels: they aſcend to receive new commiſſion from God concerning the Saints, and again deſcend to execute it; by Chriſt alſo our prayers as Intelligencers and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of our wants doe aſcend into the preſence of God: and againe his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as Angels and Meſſengers of his good will towards us, doe deſcend and light upon us. Thus is Chriſt a ladder reaching from Earth to Heaven, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of both, God and man in one perſon; our bleſſed Reconciler, and Peace-maker: he died to purchaſe peace for us: when he went away he left his peace with us: and he reignes for ever to maintaine our peace. <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, King of Peace, nominally and in a figure onely<hi>:</hi> but Chriſt is the very body and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that ſhadow.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is a moſt juſt and righteous King: he raignes in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, he ſpeakes in righteouſneſſe, he makes warre in righteouſneſſe, he betroths his Church to him in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, he delivers her from her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in righteouſneſſe, he anſwers her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29795:80"/>
prayers in righteouſneſſe, he doth all in righteouſneſſe. Neither is he perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally righteous alone; but efficiently alſo: not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly righteous himſelfe; but he makes others ſo too; <hi>juſt, and a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifier,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is: called therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. He is our true <hi>Melchiſedec, King of Righteouſneſſe:</hi> that King in <hi>Abrahams</hi> dayes bore the name, that he might be a Type of our King.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is a moſt mild and mercifull King, meeke, gentle, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: he is the true propitiatory, or Mercy-ſeate: that in the Tabernacle of old did but prefigure him: hee keeps mercy for thouſands; his mercy is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting<hi>:</hi> his mercy indureth for ever is the <hi>verſus amoebaeus,</hi> or the bearing of the ſong, as we ſay, in the 136. <hi>Pſalme;</hi> He delights in mercy: yea, it is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, that even in wrath hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members it; he beares long with his Enemies, he forgives them, he dies for them, hee ſaves them eternally, and crownes them with glory for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you, that Chriſt is a King, a Spirituall King, a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall King over all Nations, rankes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29795:80"/>
of men, ages of the world, and over all Creatures: a King ruling alone without a mate or aſſociate; an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting King, and eminent above all other Kings in all royall vertues and qualifications, as wiſdome, fortitude, peaceableneſſe, Righteouſneſſe, Mercy, and the like. Where ſhall we finde ſuch a King, as this? It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that there was <hi>no King like him,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Joſiah:</hi> but it may more truly and properly be ſaid ſo of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the heavenly King. On Earth there be Kings, that have rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination over other Kings: but Chriſt hath them at his ſteps and under his girdle, as we ſay: and they for the moſt part have ſuch command by uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and incroachment: but Chriſt is ſo conſtituted of his Father; <hi>I will make him my firſt-borne, higher then the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 89. 27. and all this is for the good of the Saints: certainly then Chriſt muſt needs be very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto Beleevers.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, I come now to commend him to you as God: and here wee be come to the ſupreame and higheſt pitch of all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29795:81"/>
glory. Here are fathomleſſe depths, and bottomleſſe bottomes, if I may ſo ſpeake: here are ſtupendious and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Myſteries; aſtoniſhing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding excellencies, ſuch as the holy Angels themſelves cannot pierce into: God is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>dwelling in inacceſſible light,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 16. here are ſuch beauties and perfections, that had I (as the Poet ſpeakes) a hundred tongues, a hundred mouthes, and a voyce of ſteele: yet I could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently deſcribe them: but muſt be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Philoſopher to aske more dayes to thinke of it; and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, as he did, that the matter is ſo intricate and perplexed, ſo inſcrutable, and unſearchable, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. Nevertheleſſe let me ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though I doe it but ſlenderly and weakely, as children doe of mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Chriſt then is in the altitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd ſummity of all glory, one eternall God with the Father, and with the Holy Ghoſt: proved to be ſo by a cloud of witneſſes: we have the Authority of the ſacred Scriptures both in the Old and New Teſtament for it moſt frequently:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29795:81"/>
where he is called <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>onely begotten Sonne of God, the Image of the Father, his ſubſtantiall Image,</hi> and not as the forme of a face in a glaſſe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lſo to him are attributed ſuch things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> can agree to none but God: he is ſaid to be equall with the Father, eternall, the author of election, a ſearcher of hearts; one that muſt be beleev'd in, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orne by, worſhipped with Divine worſhip; one that gives eternall rewards; one that hath power to pardon ſinne; one that doth illuminate by the Spirit; one that ſhall judge both quick and dead; one that is omnipotent; one that hath power to worke Miracles, to create, to ſend the Holy-Ghoſt; one that hath power to raiſe himſelfe and others; one in whoſe name we muſt be baptiſed, and the like. <hi>Paraeus</hi> that Godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divine of <hi>Heidelburgh</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the Revelation, pick's out of the text of that booke no leſſe then forty two Arguments of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt. By all which wee may ſee the blaſphemy of thoſe, who have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him to be no more then a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular God, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>patri;</hi> but not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, like unto the Father; but not of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29795:82"/>
the ſame Eſſence and ſubſtance with him. But we ſhall farther ſee the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe men, if wee conſider theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Chriſt ſhines as a Sunne in the firmament of the world, in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſufficiency of wiſdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, goodneſſe, love, Majeſty and glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whatſoever meaſure the moſt excellent of the creatures have of theſe things they are beholding unto him for it: he is the never failing ſpring and fountaine of all bleſſing and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now the Logicall Rule is, <hi>quod efficit tale, illud magis eſt tale,</hi> that which makes a thing to be ſo as it is, is much more ſo it ſelfe: if the creatures be full of beauty and excellency, and yet all in a derivative way: how unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably excellent then and beautifull is he, that is the Beginning of the creatures of God, and made them all ſo as they are? whatſoever energes or powers they have, they are but relative and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Light of the Moone from the Sunne, and alſo ſubject to ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: but in Chriſt according to his God-head all is abſolute, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate; and all without him is <hi>by him</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:29795:82"/>
               <hi>and for him: of him, and through him, and to him are all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ro.</hi> 11, 36. Great diſpute hath been among the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> about the <hi>Summum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the chiefe and ſoveraigne good: now loe here it is. <hi>Finis et bonum conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>untur,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Logician,</hi> the end, and good are coincident and come both to one. Chriſt then being God, and God the ultimate and fartheſt end of all things; it followes neceſſarily, that Chriſt is the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> and the top of all felicity and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whatſoever vertue or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in the creature, it is not of the eſſence and ſubſtance of the creature, but onely an accident, or an inherent quality: as a man may be ſaid to be wiſe, mighty, juſt, mercifull; but not wiſdome, ſtrength, Juſtice, and mercy, as God may; who is all this, and much more in the very abſtract, as we ſpeake: whatſoever then is properly attributed unto Chriſt, as God, we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it from his very eſſence. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſubſtances and materiall things, to have accidents adhering and cleaving unto them: but God is immateriall, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without matter, and above
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29795:83"/>
all ſubſtance; and therefore above all predicament, as time, place, quantity, quality, and the like: Whatſoever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in God, it is eſſentiall to him; a man may be a man ſtill, though he be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing, nor valiant, nor juſt, nor gracious; but take away theſe from God, and you deſtroy his very eſſence and being. Now then if Chriſt be God, we may ſee by this, that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurmount in praiſes all the moſt lovely and moſt deſirable creatures in the world. Marke how the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes them all in relation to God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 15. 17. He ſaith, <hi>that al Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are unto God as a droppe of water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bucket-full, or as the ſmall duſt that cleaves to the balance,</hi> is to the great and heavie weights, that are put therein: and yet this is not enough to ſhew the diſparity; therefore the Prophet addes, that they are to God as <hi>nothing:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this ſuffice to empty the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enough; but he goes a degree far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaith, that they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of God <hi>leſſe then nothing and vanity.</hi> Now beleeve it, all this is no more then is true of Chriſt: he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his God-head arayed with

all this glory: all the creatures are to him, but as dropps to bucket-fulls, or as motes to ponderous weights: yea, they are as nothing, and leſſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vanity. Chriſt hath a name above every name; all creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth, and under the Earth muſt ſtoop to him: I may truly ſay, that they be all to him, but as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a ſhadow, like the reflection of a Raine-bow, when it ſeemes to bee doubled in the cloud. The Raine-bow it ſelfe is but a ſhadow; what is then the ſhadow of this ſhadow? nay, what is the third generation of a ſhadow? as ſometimes, when the reflection is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, three are ſeene at once. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all creatures, even the moſt excellent of them muſt ſtand in the very loweſt degree of theſe, if compared unto Chriſt; how precious then, how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy beyond all thought and computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is he?</p>
            <p>Let us draw ſome concluſions from the God-head of Chriſt farther to ſet forth his preciouſneſſe, and then wee will conclude this moſt weighty and conſiderable reaſon. We will doe it by Scripture aphoriſmes, and the firſt ſhall be this.</p>

               <hi>Faire weather cometh out of the North, with God is terrible Majeſty, Job</hi> 37. 22. the meaning of it is this, that though the creature may be pleaſing and flexible enough, and there may be faire quarter between man and man: yet not ſo with God: if he be once provok't, with him there is terrible and dreadfull Majeſty. Now this is true of Chriſt. <hi>Behold, I ſend mine Angel before thee</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to keepe thee in the way, and to bring thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place, which I have prepared: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him, and obey his voyce, provoke him not: for he will not pardon your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; for my name is in him,</hi> Exod. 23. 20. 21. The Angel here ſpoken of is Chriſt, as appeares by this, that he hath power to pardon ſinne, and Gods name is in him, that is, he is eſſentially God: for Gods name and attributes are his very eſſence. But what is this to the preciouſneſſe of Chriſt, you will ſay? here is terrour and dread-ſtriking Majeſty: but what makes this to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in hand? I anſwer, very much: for firſt of all Gods terribleneſſe doth not impeach the happie condition of the Saints, becauſe they be in Chriſt: the terrours of the Law cannot reach them:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29795:84"/>
their hearts are ſo fortified and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Faith, that they are able to meditate of death, and Hell, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the moſt terrible things that are, without trembling, without any ſlaviſh feare or dread <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 33. 18.</note>. Secondly, it makes very much for the good of the Church of God, that ſome by the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning terrour of Judgements are reduced to obedience and good order; &amp; others, that are refractory and incorrigible, are cut off by the ſtroke of them: this I ſay, makes much for the good of the Church: when noxious humours are purged out of the body, all the parts are at eaſe, and in a healthfull State: ſo when wicked men are either awed and repreſſed, or quite extinct and cut off, the corporation of the Saints muſt needs enjoy much peace and quietneſſe thereby. The terrour then that is in Chriſt doth not a whit take off from his preciouſneſſe. What Saint is there, that doth not with much comfort and hearts contentment read that place of Scripture, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 15, 16. <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captaines, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:29795:85"/>
               <hi>every free-man hid themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the Mountaines: and ſaid to the Mountaines and rockes, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> The men that are here in ſuch a feare, are the enemies of the Church; and what faithfull ſoule doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the ruine of ſuch? Secondly, <hi>God cannot lye</hi> is another Scripture A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. then if Chriſt bee God, we may build upon this, that all his promiſes, and particularly thoſe concerning eternall Life and ſalvation, ſhall ſurely be made good: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in the place to <hi>Titus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned: <hi>in hope of eternall life, which God that cannot lie, promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> before the world began.</hi> Chriſt is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>verax,</hi> ſpeaking truly; but <hi>ipſa ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas,</hi> truth it ſelfe. He is <hi>the Amen; the faithfull and true witneſſe: Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, before one jot or tittle of his word ſhall fall to the ground.</hi> Now this likewiſe ſets forth the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt not a little. Among men he is counted a very choyce and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29795:85"/>
precious perſon, that is a man of his word: how much more then is Chriſt precious, whoſe eternall eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is Truth, who cannot lie as men can, and with whom there is not the leaſt variableneſſe, or ſhadow of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whatſoever God doth, it ſhall be for ever, &amp;c. is another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aphoriſme, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 14. Then let the Devill himſelfe and all enemies doe their worſt: they ſhall never be able with all their might and policy, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and Stratagenis to overthrow and fruſtrate the ſalvation of Gods elect: but it ſhall abide forever more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then the ancient Mountaines and everlaſting hills of the world: and this muſt needs be ſo; becauſe their Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is God, God by nature, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Divine power, ſuch as all creatures, even the moſt able of them, muſt yeild unto. Now what is there, that can make Chriſt more precious to a believing ſoule, than this? God it is, that workes all our workes in us, and for us; the whole ſtructure of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is of his founding and raiſing; and whatſoever God doth, it ſhall be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29795:86"/>
for ever, nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: now wee have abundantly proved, that Chriſt is God: our ſalvation then doth not ſtand upon our owne mutable and variable will; nor upon the weake legges of our owne power, which is as nothing; but upon the unchangeable counſell and mighty power of God; in which our Lord Jeſus hath as great a ſhare, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Father, or the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you ſome taſte of Scripture aphoriſmes, as I call them lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt to private obſervation and collection. And this know aſſuredly, that whatſoever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct to a beleeving ſoule, becauſe he is moſt abſolute for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſupply: and the ſupply which he makes to Beleevers is,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Full.</item>
               <item>2. Sutable.</item>
               <item>3. Conſtant.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:29795:86"/>
Firſt, it is a full ſupply, if there be Light in the Sunne, the aire cannot be darke<hi>:</hi> if there be ſappe in the ſtock, the branches cannot be dry: if there be fulneſſe in the fountaine the ſtreames cannot be empty.</p>
            <p>This full ſupply through Chriſt is manifeſted by all thoſe types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, which of old had relation to him. The ſtriking of the bloud of the Paſcall Lamb on the poſts of the doores, where the Iſraelites dwelt was a token and aſſurance to them, that the deſtroying Angel ſhould paſſe over them, and ſmite onely, the firſt borne of the Egyptians<hi>:</hi> now what elſe did that bloud prefigure but the bloud of Chriſt? wherewith the Elect being ſprinckled, the Deſtroyer cannot hurt them. This bloud certainely is the inke of the Angels inke-home, ſpoken of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 3. wherewith the Godly are marked for deliverance, while others periſh and are cut off. The pillar of the cloud by day, and of fire by night was a type of Chriſt, leading and guiding his people continually. The water of the Rock and the <hi>Manna</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were ſignes, that Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29795:87"/>
ſpiritually feed and refreſh his people. The Serpent of braſſe lifted up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſignified, that he ſhould be their Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian and healer. All the ſacrifices of the Law did typifie, that Chriſt ſhould make atonement for Beleevers. The Arke or Holy Cheſt in the Tabernacle did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe repreſent Chriſt unto us; in whom God hath treaſured up all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of wiſdome, grace, power, goodneſſe and mercy: <hi>for it pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell, Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 19. Now from the redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and overflowing fulneſſe of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that is in Chriſt, Beleevers doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their ſufficiencie and fulneſſe: <hi>of his fulneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>wee all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1. 16. that is, graces anſwerable to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable grace of Chriſt: that as face anſwereth to face in water, ſo wee may in all things be like unto our head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſupply that wee have by Chriſt is ſutable alſo. The faithfull ſoule lookes upon him, and ſaith, loe, here is moſt precious and pure bloud to waſh away my guilt; here is ſtrength to ſupport me in my weakneſſe; here is a garment of righteouſneſſe to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29795:87"/>
cover the ſhame of my nakedneſſe; here is a ſpirit of Truth to leade me and guide me in all my wayes; here are ſweet mercies and conſolations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me in my droopings; here are gold and Pearles, and precious ſtones to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich me with; here is perfect purity and holineſſe to ſanctifie and cleanſe my corrupt nature; in a word here is the plenitude and fulneſſe of all grace to fill my empty and deſtitute ſoule.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the Lord anointed Chriſt, and did ſolemnly deſigne him to be home unto every Saints conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>to be made</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe) <hi>all things to all men: he was anointed to preach good tidings unto the meeke, to bind up broken hearts, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 1. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Liberty to captives, to appoint beauty for aſhes, joy for mourning, and garments of feſtivity, and praiſe for ſad and heavie ſpirits.</hi> Chriſt is (as I may ſay) for every turne: hee hath in him ſufficiency relative and ſutable to all conditions: there is no diſeaſe, but this Phiſician can cure, no caſe, but this Counſellour can reſolveus, and direct us in, no Enemie, but this Champion can conquer, no difficulty, but this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29795:88"/>
mighty Saviour can overcome: he is made unto us of God all that we ſtand in neede of, wiſdome to cure our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteouſneſſe to juſtifie our perſons, Sanctification to purifie our nature, and Redemption from thoſe many ſorrowes and miſeries, which we here are ſubject to. As <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that he was <hi>eyes to the blind, and feete to the Lame, and a Father to the poore:</hi> ſo is Chriſt made every thing unto Beleevers in proportion to their wants. As <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when he raiſed a child to life, <hi>put his mouth upon the childs mouth, his eyes upon the childs eyes, his hands upon the childs hands,</hi> ſtill ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar parts were applyed to ſimilar: ſo doth Chriſt apply himſelfe to us in a relation ſuting and anſwering to every neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſupply that wee have from him is likewiſe conſtant: 'tis not like a winter-bourne, that failes, and dries up in the Summer: but it is as the ſtreames of living waters, and of an ever-ſpringing Fountaine. Chriſt doth not onely give grace: but maintaines it. It was a juſt complaint which long agoe was made againſt the Heathen Gods;</p>

They could give their Favourites great gifts; but they could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in the poſſeſſion of them. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour is not ſo<hi>:</hi> he gives to his Saints not onely the firſt grace; but the grace of perſeverance alſo. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>thou maintaineſt my lot:</hi> ſo doth Chriſt maintaine that lot of grace, which he beſtowes upon his faithfull Members: he is the Author, and finiſher of our faith: <hi>his gifts and calling are</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> he is not like the fooliſh man, that began to build and was not able to finiſh: but having begun a good worke in his Saints, hee will finiſh it, and make it perſevere unto his owne day: and then when grace is full hee will crowne it with eternall glory. Now by that which hath been ſaid, we may ſee that the condition of Beleevers, and of ſuch as are ingraffed into Chriſt, is farre better, then was that of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency: he had excellent gifts of knowledg and grace conferred upon him: but hee was never confirm'd in them: and therefore being left to the mutability of his owne will, he choſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29795:89"/>
the evill, and loſt the good: but it is not ſo with the Saints now, under the Covenant of grace by Chriſt; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever heavenly endowments they have, they are confirmed and eſtabliſhed in them; ſo that they can never be loſt. <hi>Marie's</hi> good part, which ſhe had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, could <hi>never be taken from her.</hi> The Saints and their graces are in the hand of God; and who can ſnatch them out of that mighty and powerfull hand? <hi>Mount Zion ſtandeth faſt for ever:</hi> and <hi>the Lord is about his people, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1 Kings 7. 21.</note> 21. as much as to ſay <hi>ſtability</hi> and <hi>ſtrength:</hi> now what doth this figure unto us? but the more then brazen ſtedfaſtneſſe and ſtrength of the Church of God, of all the members of it, and of all their ſaving graces; which can never periſh, never decay; but ſhall dure beyond the world unto all eternity, never to be broken, as the two ſtaffes <hi>Beauty and Bands</hi> were, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">Zach. 11. 10. 14.</note> ſpeakes of<hi>:</hi> but ſtill to be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Fifthly, looke upon Chriſt as upon <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label> the moſt gainfull and profitable thing to the ſoule, that can bee imagined: nothing more commodious, nothing more enriching then Chriſt is. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Chriſt is abſolute gaine.

            <p>Firſt, he is abſolute gaine: abſolute, becauſe whatſoever we give unto him, we loſe it not, there is no alienation of it: but it is ours ſtill, and ours in a farre ſafer cuſtody and keeping, then in our owne: if wee caſt our affections upon Chriſt, they be not loſt: hee onely makes them better<hi>:</hi> if wee give them to the world, they differ little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the affections of beaſts: but if Chriſt have them, he makes heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gracious, and ſuch as will fit us for the preſence of God: if wee lay downe our lives for him, they be not loſt neither, but gained unto life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 39.</p>
            <p>Againe, the neceſſity of getting Chriſt makes him to be abſolute gaine to ſuch,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29795:90"/>
as have him: the neceſſity of a thing puts worth upon it: it is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be rich, or honourable, or great in the world: but Chriſt being the life of our ſoules, and one without whom wee cannot ſubſiſt happily; he muſt needs be of abſolute neceſſity<hi>:</hi> and therefore abſolute gaine unto us. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you can doe nothing,</hi> Joh, 15. 5. As the branch cannot beare fruite, except it abide in the vine; and if it beare no fruit, men caſt it into the fire and burne it: ſo if we bee not in Chriſt, and abide in him; we can beare no good fruite: and for ſuch, as beare no good fruite, the fire of <hi>Gehenna</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: how abſolutely neceſſary the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is Chriſt? and how abſolutely gainfull to us, if once wee have him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is univerſally gaine?</p>
            <p>Firſt, univerſall for all perſons, rich, and poore; young, and old; noble, and ignoble; Learned, and unlearned; bond, and free: there is no man rich without Chriſt: neither is there any poore, that have him: none noble without him; none ignoble with him: none learned, or free without him; none bond, or unlearned with him.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29795:90"/>
There be diſtinctions in the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, honouring ſome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing others; exalting ſome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing others: but in the body of Chriſt they are not to be found. <hi>There is neither Jew, nor Greeke; there is neither bond, nor free; there is neither male, nor female: for yee are all one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is univerſall gaine in reſpect of all times. <hi>All things are beautifull in their ſeaſon,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> Muſick is good: but it is ſo onely in a time fit for mirth: food is good: but it is ſo onely when men are hungry: cloathing is good: but it is then for them that are naked: and Phyſicke alſo is good; but it is when men are ſick and diſtempered: but Chriſt is ſeaſonable at all times; he is that tree of life, that beares <hi>twelve ſorts of fruit;</hi> and before the old ſtore is done, new comes: for <hi>it yeilds fruit every moneth, Revel.</hi> 22. 2. Chriſt is never out of ſeaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore univerſally gainfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is gaine alſo to all things. In Chriſt are made unto us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of all ſorts, both of this life, and of that, which is to come: for which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29795:91"/>
cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Godlineſſe is profitable for all things.</hi> When the Prophet ſaith, that <hi>the juſt ſhall live by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>his Faith;</hi> we muſt conceive, that it is true as well of food, and rayment, and temporall deliverance, as of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification, and eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: this is not ſo well obſerv'd by Chriſtians, as it ought to be: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can truſt Chriſt with their ſoules; but not with their bodies, not with their Eſtates. <hi>Peter</hi> reſted upon him for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; <hi>thou haſt the words of eternall life,</hi> ſaith he<hi>:</hi> but hee could not truſt him with the ſafety of his fleſh: for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him on the water, he doubted, and <hi>began to ſinke.</hi> But beleeve it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our weakneſſes are; whatſoever our ignorance, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doubting, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe; Chriſt is profitable for all things; both for ſoule and body, for this life, and for the life to come for ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is gaine for himſelf, other things are gainefull in aſpect and relation to their ends; as wealth is good to ſupply want, food to maintaine life, cloathes to keep off the cold aire, a ſtaffe to ſupport feeble legges, a bed to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29795:91"/>
reſt wearie limbes on, and the like: but Chriſt is a rich and ineſtimable treaſure to the ſoule, without reference to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end then himſelfe: he is to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red even for himſelfe. <hi>Wiſdome is better then Rubies; and all the things, that may be deſired, are not to be compared to it,</hi> Proverb. 8. 11. And doubtleſſe Chriſt is the wiſdome there ſpoken of. Now then if Chriſt be the moſt gainefull thing in the world, abſolute gaine, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall gaine, and gaine for himſelfe, without aime at ſome better thing: if Chriſt be thus gainefull, I ſay, who can denie him to be moſt precious and excellent? I paſſe to a ſixt Reaſon.</p>

            <p>Firſt of his love, <hi>Magnes amoris eſt amor:</hi> Love is the attractive Load-ſtone of Love: and never was there ſuch a love, as Chriſts love to his Elect; free and undeſerved; from everlaſting to everlaſting; caſt upon them even when they were enemies, and in their ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chous
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29795:92"/>
graſſations and rebellions; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming all difficulties and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all peeviſh frowardneſſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications after reconcilement; never wearled or tired out with any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a love lifting up <hi>Adam,</hi> Earthly man as high as Heaven, and tranſlating <hi>Enoch,</hi> miſerable and enthralled man into the glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God; a love infinite, and paſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending: ſo that well might the Apoſtle ſet a <hi>Behold</hi> to it: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that wee ſhould be called the Sonnes of God, Joh.</hi> 3. 1. and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not alone in this Love; but the Sonne and the Holy-Ghoſt too: if the love of the Saints to Chriſt be ſo hot, that <hi>many waters of affliction cannot quench it,</hi> nor the flouds of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drowne it; if it will not be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or exchanged for any wealth: if it <hi>be ſtrong as death and cruell as the grave,</hi> urging and conſtraining them to lay downe life and all for him; if the coales thereof be <hi>coales of fire,</hi> which hath a moſt vehement flame, as we reade, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6, 7. What is then the love of Chriſt to his people, who is not onely loving
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29795:92"/>
but love it ſelfe in the very abſtract? certainly ſuch a love as this cannot but be very attractive and drawing, very conciliating and winning: it muſt needs like the firſt wheele move and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all our affections; our deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Chriſt, our joy in the fruition of him, our love toward him, our feare to diſpleaſe him, our anger, when he is offended, our jealouſie of loſing him. Our nature is ſuch, that wee will love, where we are firſt loved; as the heat of the Sunne-beames reflects from a wall: ſo Chriſts love to us cannot but cauſe a reflection of ours upon him: ours is but a ſparke of his: <hi>we love him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe hee loved us first:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 19.</note> when he reveales his love to us, ſuch a fire muſt needs kindle and melt our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, be they never ſo key-cold and frozen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the beauty of Chriſt is likewiſe very attractive. I doe not meane it of the aſpect and face, of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lineaments and proportion of his body, although his comlineſſe in that behalfe need not to be doubted of, being formed in the ſanctified wombe of a Virgine by the Holy-Ghoſt: but of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29795:93"/>
his ſpirituall beauty and gracefulneſſe. Now wee know, that true beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts</p>
            <p>In faireneſſe of complexion.</p>
            <p>And in a juſt ſymmetry or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of parts.</p>
            <p>Neither of theſe was wanting in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he was of a faire and comely complexion, as the Church deſcribeth him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy,</hi> ſaith ſhe, the mixture of theſe two colours makes a beautifull and good complexion: <hi>White</hi> and <hi>red</hi> as they ſhew the beſt temperature in man; ſo here it may ſignifie in Chriſt his God-head and manhood. God appeared in a viſion <hi>all white as ſnow, and pure as fine wooll, Dan.</hi> 7. 9. And man had his name <hi>Adam</hi> from the red mould or Earth, that his body was made of: and Chriſt vouchſafed to be like unto us in this. Againe, the red colour may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the bloudy ſufferings of Chriſt: and the white his righteouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; inherent in himſelfe; but convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all his members by Gods free im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: righteouſneſſe is ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>white linnen, Revel.</hi> 19. 8. Now
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29795:93"/>
this temperament, and mingling of white and red after ſuch a myſticall way in Chriſt, denotes the ſurpaſſing beautie of Chriſt, makes him precious to the Saints, and inflames their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to embrace him, and follow him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in Chriſt there is alſo a comely proportion of parts: from the correſpondency and agreement of parts ariſeth a feature compleatly beautifull and lovely. This every faithfull ſoule findes in Chriſt. The Church enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and reckons up all his parts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. &amp;c. <hi>his head as moſt fine gold; his lockes buſhie, and blacke as a Raven,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well agreeing with <hi>a faire face; his eyes as the eyes of Doves by the rivers of water, waſhed with milke, and fitly ſet; his cheekes as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; his lips like Lillies, dropping ſweet-ſmelling mirrhe; his hands as gold Rings, ſet with the Berill; his belly as bright Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie overlaid with Saphires; his legges as pillars of Marble ſet upon ſockets of fine Gold; his counteance as Lebanon, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as the Cedars; and his mouth or voyce moſt ſweet:</hi> What a pleaſant harmony and ſpecious conſent of parts is here?
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29795:94"/>
figuring unto us the ſupreame and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Government of Chriſt, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Councells, his pure nature hating all impurity and uncleanneſſe, his amiable and delightfull ſmilings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Saints, his gracious promiſes and ſoule-ſaving inſtructions, all his actions and adminiſtrations juſt and holy, his mercies and inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very precious like the Saphire, that glittereth with golden points, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of his ſpirit in his Saints, moſt firme and ſtedfaſt like marble pillars, the whole ſhew and caſt of his perſon moſt glorious, moſt excellent, moſt Majeſticall, and yet moſt delightfull, like the forreſt of Lebanon, and the ſtately Cedars, that grew in it: ſo that he is altogether lovely; all over from top to toe (as we ſay) deſirable, and the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, as much as to ſay, matchleſſe and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable: on earth and in all the world there is not his like, who is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot or blemiſh; yea, who is made and not made; a creature, and yet the mighty Creatour of all things, God and man in one perſon, wholy excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and beautifull, every part ſutable,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29795:94"/>
a moſt raviſhing and wooing object.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is attractive in his graces conſidered, either as inherent in himſelfe,</p>
            <p>Or infuſed into Beleevers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as they be inherent in himſelfe, they tranſcend in excellency all the thought and conceit both of men and Angels<hi>:</hi> they have (if I may ſo ſpeake) a moſt fragrant ſmell and allicient qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them, compared therefore to ſweet ſpices and ointments, as <hi>myrrhe, aloes, frankincenſe, ſpikenard,</hi> and the like. As theſe are delightfull to our ſenſes: ſo are the graces of Chriſt to a beleeving ſoule, attracting the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, winning the love of the heart, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all other things vile and baſe in compariſon of him; that the ſoule loathes them, and ſpues at them, as I may ſay, when they offer to ſtand in competition with him. It was the grace of Chriſt, that made him ſo glorious as we read of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>We beheld his glory</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, full of grace and truth;</hi> that is, wee beheld him glorious in all perfection of grace, wiſdome, goodneſſe, and Mercy. It is the gemme or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29795:95"/>
in a ring, that makes it very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and beautifull; ſo it is the grace, that God hath treaſured up in Chriſt, which makes him ſo glorious, ſo attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and ſo alluring as he is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is attractive in his graces beſtowed upon the Saints. As a Father is dignified by having a worthy ſonne, and a School-maſter by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and proficiency of his Scholars: ſo is Chriſt by the Graces of his people. A Maſter is honoured by his livery, which his ſervants weare: now the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of love, and humility, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and patience, and the like, are, as I may ſay, Chriſts livery, by which wee are diſtinguiſhed, and known to be his ſervants: and he is much honoured by thoſe badges: <hi>By this ſhall all men know</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that you are my Diſciples, if you love one another.</hi> Joh. 13. 35. The holy lives and bleſſed examples of the Saints are very fruitful; they advance the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, and are very attractive things to tole and draw on others to a liking of his wayes. <hi>Yee wives</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be in ſubjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the Word, they alſo may without the Word be wonne</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:29795:95"/>
               <hi>by the converſation of the wives, while they behold your chaſt, or modeſt converſation, coupled with feare,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2. Not that the examples even of the beſt can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a ſinner; for that is done onely by the preaching of the Goſpel; but they may doe this; they may ſhew a ſinner the vileneſſe and the danger of his own way; becauſe they be light; they may alſo allure him and draw him on to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the holy wayes of Chriſt, and ſo prepare him to heare that word, which is of power to beget faith, and to ſave the ſoule. And hither tends that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 14. 7. <hi>They that dwell under his ſhadow ſhall returne, they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, as the corne, and grow as the vine: the ſent thereof ſhall be as the wine of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon:</hi> The meaning of it is this, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> being converted, others that dwell under his ſhadow, beholding his wayes, and approving them, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: he ſhall caſt forth ſuch a ſweet ſavour of holy converſation, that others not yet wrought upon, ſhall revive as the corne after the dead winter, flouriſh like the vine, and give a ſent as fragrant and delightfull as the wine of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> The graces then of the Saints doe very much
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29795:96"/>
decorate and adorne Chriſt himſelfe. As a faire and beautifull woman, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and holy, is a credit to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o are the godly to Chriſt: they are his Spouſe, they are his Members, they are his Children, they are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they are his Scholars; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is excellent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in them, it redounds to his praiſe. They be branches of his planting, and the worke of his hands, and he is glorified in them, as the Prophet ſpeaks: If the viſible heavens do declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith; how much more then doe the new heavens, I meane the new creature, the perſons of men new moulded and formed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe to the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and likeneſſe of God; how much more, I ſay, doe theſe declare the glory of Chriſt, whoſe handy-worke they are? Hence is that ſaying of the Apoſtle; <hi>If our Brethren be enquired of; they are the meſſengers of the Churches, and the glory of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 23. And in another place he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt preſents his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Church to himſelfe a glorious Church:</hi> The glory of the Church reflects upon Chriſt, who firſt founded and formed it.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29795:96"/>
Every childe of God at his converſion <hi>puts on Chriſt;</hi> whence it followeth, that whatſoever beauty and comelineſſe the Saints have, it is Chriſts beauty and comelineſſe; and he hath the praiſe of it. Thus you ſee, that Chriſt is very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive in his love, in his beauty, and in his graces, both his own and his Saints, therefore he muſt needs be very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>There is one Reaſon more, which <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>7</label> may not be omitted: Chriſt is precious to Beleevers from that evidence of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, right, and propriety, that they have in him. Much hath been ſaid of his peereleſſe and unparallel'd excellency: but what were all, if to himſelfe alone, and not to us? What is all the gold of the <hi>Indies</hi> to me, if I my ſelfe languiſh in poverty? What are the feaſts and full feeding of others to mee, if I my ſelfe ſtarve for hunger? or what is all the helpe in the world to mee, if I cannot have it at my need? Here then is the <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima lima,</hi> (as I may ſay) and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of all, that Chriſt is every way excellent, and the Saints enjoy him as their own; they have a comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29795:97"/>
               <list>
                  <item>In all his workes and performances.</item>
                  <item>In all his dignities and honours.</item>
                  <item>In all his offices and adminiſtrations.</item>
                  <item>In all his bleſſed influences and graces.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, all Chriſts workes and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, are in a peculiar reſpect for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beleever; his making of the world, ſetling of policies and governments, rooting up of Kingdomes, executing of judgements in the earth, rewarding ſome, and puniſhing others, raiſing up wiſe, learned, valiant, active, juſt and mercifull men in their times: in all theſe, and in all other generall and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall workes of Chriſt, the beleeving ſoule hath a kind of intereſt &amp; proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: next unto his own glory, Chriſt ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the good of his Church in all theſe things, and hath ſtill either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or in the upſhot and cloſe of all made them inſtrumentall for her well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: in which ſence are thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether Paul, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come; all are yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Beleevers have a kinde of claime alſo in the dignities and honours
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29795:97"/>
of Chriſt. There is a reciprocation (as I may ſay) between him and his Saints: they are mutually and interchangeably glorified in one another: as Chriſt is <hi>glorified in them,</hi> Joh. 17. 10. ſo they are unſpeakeably dignified and graced by him. <hi>The glory of children</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are their Fathers,</hi> Prov. 17. 6. If the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be heroicall, or learned, or any way excellent, this is the ſonnes glory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he degenerate: now the Saints are called the <hi>ſeede and the children of Chriſt:</hi> whatſoever therefore he excells in, it is their dignity, and their glory. Beſides, Chriſt doth impart of his honours to them, making them like himſelfe. Is Chriſt a ſonne, and heire of all? ſo are they ſonnes, and heires, and co-heires with Chriſt: ſhall he judge the world? ſo ſhall they in ſome ſort: doth he breake in pieces the Nations with a rod of iron? ſo doe they: is he aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory? ſo ſhall they aſcend: There is not any whit of his glory, unleſſe it be that which is utterly incommunicable, but they have a touch of it, if I may ſo ſpeake: yea and that which is ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, redounds to their glory, as you heard before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:29795:98"/>
Thirdly, Beleevers have intereſt in the offices of Chriſt. Every Saint may ſay of Chriſt, he is my Prophet and Teacher, he is my Prieſt and reconciler, he is my King and governour: yea the godly have ſuch an intereſt in theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, that vertue comes out of him to make even them Prophets, and Prieſts, and Kings alſo: Prophets in ſome meaſure, to teach themſelves and others, Prieſts to offer ſpirituall ſacrifices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God by Chriſt; and Kings to rule over their own luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Beleevers have alſo intereſt in the graces of Chriſt: he, that hath the field, hath alſo the treaſure, that is hid in it. It was the greateſt conſolation and joy of the Spouſe, that ſhee could ſay, <hi>My Beloved is mine.</hi> All that is in Chriſt, a Beleever may appropriate to himſelfe: he may ſay with unſpeakable delight, his riches, his love, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his greatneſſe, his power, and all that is his, is mine. I have intereſt in all thoſe tranſcendent graces of his; his mercy, his truth, his promiſes, they are all mine. Now this muſt needs render Chriſt very precious, when he is not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29795:98"/>
onely in himſelfe, whatſoever is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and deſirable: but alſo the Saints may juſtly challenge and claime him for their own.</p>
            <p>I come now to the application of the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Point. And firſt of all, it ſhews us the reaſon why the moſt in the world doe deſpiſe Chriſt, and care not for him? namely, becauſe they have no faith; they are infidells and unbeleevers; and therefore they ſet light by him. Chriſt is very precious; but it is onely to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: worldlings have no faith; and therefore Chriſt ſeemes a deſpicable and worthleſſe thing to them. Now that they have no faith, this appeares</p>
            <p>Firſt, by their ignorance. Moſt have not ſo much as the theory, or doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall knowledge of Chriſt: they are like <hi>Feſtus,</hi> who tould <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that <hi>Pauls adverſaries had queſtions againſt him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one Jeſus,</hi> Act. 25. 19. So let theſe be asked, and they can anſwer nothing truly, nothing rationally, nothing pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually of Chriſt. Chriſt is to them (as Logicians ſpeake) an <hi>Individuum vagum, quidam homo,</hi> a certain man, one Jeſus; but they for their part know little of him; onely they have a wilde hope, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29795:99"/>
if he be good for any thing, they ſhall have a ſhare in it, as well as others: and therefore, Jeſus Chriſt have mercy on us, is a frequent and high point of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: they have it by tradition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt: but what he is, and how made ours they know not.</p>
            <p>Others there be, that have pretty ſtore of knowledge; they can reaſon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Chriſt diſtinctly and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily; but they have no experimentall knowledge of him; they have not fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the work of his Spirit upon their hearts they have not taſted how gracious th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> reliſh and light taſt of him; ſuch as their is, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5. Temporary guſts &amp; apprehenſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Chriſts ſweetneſſe, cauſing <hi>joy for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> while;</hi> but they doe not ſit downe with Chriſt at his Table to eate even to ſatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (as I may ſay) and to make a full meale of his ſpirituall dainties, the <hi>heavenly Manna, the marrow of fatneſſe:</hi> neither have they <hi>drunke abundantly</hi> (as the charge is, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 1.) <hi>of wine on the lees, well refined out of Chriſts wine-cellar.</hi> In a word, they have not a thorough and ſaving experience of Chriſt: though
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29795:99"/>
their braines have ſome print of him, yet their hearts are ſtrangers to him: and therefore they have no faith: <hi>They that know Chriſts name, will put their truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 9. 10. But theſe know it not: they know not the power, they know not the vertue, they know not the worth of Chriſt; neither doe they know their owne miſery without him. And what faith can there be, where there is no knowledge? Knowledge is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to breed and beget faith, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it includes faith, and faith beares the name of it, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many:</hi> and againe, <hi>Not having mine own righteouſneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith; that I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection,</hi> Phil. 3. 9, 10. That is one token then that men have no faith becauſe they have no knowledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It appeares by their ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at Chriſt, Chriſt is a <hi>ſtone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a rocke of offence to the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith: and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ones are oppoſed to beleevers: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29795:100"/>
is the greateſt diſobedience in the world; 'tis to make God a liar, and it is the mother and damme of all other diſobedience: becauſe men beleeve not; therefore they are ſo vicious, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, ſo ungodly, and ſo diſobedient as they are: and therefore it is that Chriſt ſeemes ſo vile and ſo baſe to them as he doth: therefore it is, that they are offended with him, and ſtumble at him: overmuch haſt makes a man to ſtumble: now the Prophet ſaith, that <hi>he which beleeveth ſhall not make haſt,</hi> Eſa. 28. 16. Had the <hi>Jewes</hi> beleeved, they had never ſtumbled at Chriſt; his poverty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed condition had never been any ſcandall to them; but they not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, looked for a Saviour and a Meſſias, that ſhould come in the riches, in the glory, in the pompe and magnificence of an earthly Monarch; which whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29795:100"/>
of Chriſt; but of the ſtrict lawes of his Kingdome, and of the hard terms upon which he offers himſelfe: he tells men, that if they will be his followers, and will have him for a Saviour, then they muſt deny themſelves, renounce their own wills, take up his Croſſe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer mocks and reproaches, bonds and impriſonment, be hated and perſecuted in the world, and reſiſt even to bloud, and loſſe of life, if need be. Theſe are the termes &amp; conditions upon which Chriſt offers himſelfe: and theſe are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory, moſt cannot reliſh them, they will not downe: Chriſt is very offenſive being ſo tendred; without forme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comelineſſe, without beauty, a moſt nauſeous and loathſome object. Now where it is thus, it is evident, that men have no faith: a man will not reſt or relye upon that, which he hath no good conceit of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It appeares to be ſo alſo, when men doe not improve Chriſt. True faith is a growing thing, and makes all other graces to grow, it is not idle and lazie, but active, and advancing, and ſtill preſſing forward. What is ground, if not goodded and manured?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29795:101"/>
What is a Ship, if not rigged, and ſent to Sea? What is a trade, if not driven, and made uſe of? So what is Chriſt, if not working, not acting, not improved in us? What is his incarnation, death, reſurrection, interceſſion, if wee receive no vertue, or vigorous impreſſe, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion or augmentation from them? the buſineſſe of Chriſt in a ſoule is not a matter of words and names, as <hi>Gallio</hi> thought: but it is a work of the higheſt and greateſt concernment that can be; the aimes of it are above all created ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies: and therefore where it is true and not fained, it is ever in agitation, ever girding forward to the marke, ever building, ever running, ever growing: if not ſo, it is manifeſt that men haw no faith: and if they have no faith, it is no wonder, that they ſhould deſpiſe Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When a man is careleſſe and regardleſſe of the things of Chriſt, this is alſo an argument of a faithleſſe and unbeleeving ſoule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20, 21. the Apoſtle oppoſes <hi>Timothy</hi> (whom elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he commends for his unfained faith) unto ſuch careleſſe ones; <hi>I have no man like minded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who will</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:29795:101"/>
               <hi>naturally care for your ſtate; for all ſeeke their own, and not the things which are Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts.</hi> But how doth he meane it? did <hi>Timothy</hi> care for the <hi>Philippians</hi> as a naturall man? No; but as one that was by faith implanted into Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo had a new nature: and by the motions and inclinations of that new nature, he did as indearedly and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately tender the good ſtate of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as parents do naturally care for their children. By this Antitheſis then, or oppoſition, it appeares, that thoſe who ſought their own privacies, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt, had no faith. They might perhaps, and did in all likelihood make profeſſion of the faith: but not regarding the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and publick good of the Saints, it is evident, that all their Religion was but a vaine &amp; empty flouriſh, a meere ſhukke or ſhadow, without heart, without life, without truth and ſubſtance of grace: had they been truly of the body of Chriſt, they would have had more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſpirits, and conſidered others, as well as themſelves: So writes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; <hi>The members have the ſame care one for another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 25. And this was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29795:102"/>
his own practice, <hi>I pleaſe all men in all things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not ſeeking mine own profit; but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. laſt. And in the very ſame Chapter he gives in precept, that <hi>no man ſhould ſeeke his own; but every man anothers wealth.</hi> I confeſſe, that both theſe ſayings of his doe offer ſome hold for cavill and exception: as where he ſaith, that <hi>he pleaſed all men in all things;</hi> it may ſeeme that he was then a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a time-ſerver; but yet wee muſt not ſo underſtand it; for he intends it no queſtion, of his care not to give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any, as appeares by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. And againe whereas he ſaith, <hi>Let no man ſeeke his owne, but every man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wealth;</hi> wee muſt not conceive, that he doth enjoyne ſelfe-neglect; but onely he gives a charge againſt ſelf-love, to wit, that no man ſhould ſo ſeeke his owne, as wholly to neglect the benefit of others, and eſpecially their ſpirituall benefit: yet thus it is with many in the world, who notwithſtanding make a glorious ſhew of better things: let the cauſe of Chriſt, let his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſinke or ſwimme, tis all one to them; like <hi>Gallio</hi> they care for no ſuch matters.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29795:102"/>
               <hi>Eli's</hi> heart trembled when he heard, that the Arke of God was taken: but let newes of the ill ſucceſſe of the Saints come to theſe, and it never troubles them: they will make ſome ſhew of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with their tongues; but there is not a whit in their hearts. Now certainly, here can be no faith. Tis the right guiſe of Infidells, to call the Church an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>This is Zion, whom no man ſeeketh after,</hi> Jer. 30. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Antiqu: lib. 8. c. 2.</note> writes, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was not ſo intent and earneſt in building of his own pallace, as he was in the ſtructure of the Temple; becauſe the one was for God; but the other for Kings.</q> Cleane contrary to which was the practiſe of thoſe, that <hi>dwelt in their ſeeled houſes, and let the houſe of God lie waſt,</hi> Hag. 1. 4. Doubtleſſe, where there is ſuch ſlighting of God, and of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſuch intenſive care of private concernments, there can be no faith. As a man beleeves, ſo he cares for the things of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, When men procraſtinate and delay their ſeeking of Chriſt, putting off this great and neceſſary work from day to day, giving the prime, the morning,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29795:103"/>
and the virginity of their affections (as I may ſay) to the world, proſtituting their precious ſoules to ſuch baſe, vile, and worthleſſe thinge: this is alſo a ſigne of a faithleſſe heart, and conſequently, that Chriſt is little ſet by. <hi>Yee cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>Mammon</hi> is a rabinicall word, ſignifying plenty of riches and worldly wealth: ſome ſay it comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a multitude: now as Beleevers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating upon the copious theame of the love of Chriſt, doe as it were loſe their hearts and affections in the bottomleſſe depth of his unſearchable riches and grace: ſo worldlings doe in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ingurgitate and drowne their ſpirits in the endleſſe and unſatiable deſire of worldly riches and pleaſures: and when they thus ſerve <hi>Mammon,</hi> how can they doe <hi>the worke of God, to beleeve on him, whom he hath ſeat? The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> that is, the inordinate deſire of earthly pleaſures, and riches, and honours; theſe are of the world, as the Apoſtle ſaith; and we all know, that the world and the Elect are <hi>ê regione</hi> (as wee ſay) diametrically oppoſite and contrary one
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29795:103"/>
to the other: and if ſo, then certainly where there are thoſe luſts and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires, there can be no faith; for faith is proper to the Elect; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>the faith of Gods Elect, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. Neither will it ſerve the turne for men to ſay within themſelves, as many doe, that there will be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſeeke Chriſt hereafter: for the preſent it will be beſt to follow after pleaſures, and to purſue the world; when gray haires, and old age comes, then 'twill be rathe enough to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, after Chriſt, after grace; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this is a moſt deſperate reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for know aſſuredly, that though many ſeeme to ſeeke Chriſt in the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light (as I may ſay) and evening of their lives; yet in the upſhot and cloſe of all he is not found: though men ſeeme to leave their ſinnes, when they be old; yet for the moſt part, it is not ſo; but rather ſinne leaves them; for were they young and luſty, as they have been, they would be as forward to act it, as ever. Now where there is no ſeeking, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt, there cannot be any faith at all.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, When men can ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29795:104"/>
and ſatisfied without Chriſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſſe him, never feele the want of him; this doth alſo argue a ſtate of unbeliefe. Every true Beleever makes Chriſt the center and reſt of his ſoule. All things tend naturally to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, as light things upward, and heavie things downward: ſo the nature of faith is to flie up unto Chriſt, who is (as I may ſay) the boſome of perfect reſt and repoſe. Thoſe that have been moſt eminent for faith, could never endure the abſence of Chriſt: they have ſtill borne it very impatiently, very eagerly and diſcontentedly. The Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes her ſelfe to be <hi>ſicke of love for him, Cantic.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule <hi>panted after him, as the hunted or chaſed Hart doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the water-brookes.</hi> And the people of God ſay, <hi>The deſire of our ſoule is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ule have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within mee will I ſeeke thee early,</hi> Eſa. 26. 8, 9. Now, I muſt tell you, that it was faith, which cauſed ſuch love-ſickneſſe in the Spouſe, ſuch panting and thirſting in <hi>David,</hi> and ſuch ſoule-deſires, ſuch inceſſant ſeeking of Chriſt in thoſe godly ones, that wee
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29795:104"/>
reade of: <hi>Give me children, or elſe I dye,</hi> ſaid <hi>Rachell:</hi> ſo certainly nothing can quiet and content the minde of a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but union and communion with Chriſt. It argues then a dead, darke, a hopeleſſe, a faithleſſe condition, when the ſoule can goe whole moneths and yeares, pleaſing it ſelfe with rattles and toys, as I may ſay; and never labour for ſweet intercourſe or commerce with Chriſt: at the very beſt here can be no better then a divided eſteeme of Chriſt, which is nothing worth. When the heart is divided between Chriſt and the world, there is alwaies a diſproportion: the world hath moſt, and Chriſt leaſt: yea even then, when Chriſt ſeemes to have moſt; yet it is but occaſionall: dangers, feares, the ficke bed, a ſpirit of bondage, ſtings of conſcience, and the like, may perhaps make Chriſt moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhable for a ſpirt; but when the fit or ſtorme is over, and God gives reſpit; then the heart is hardened like <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> and there is a returning <hi>with the dogge</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 22.</note> 
               <hi>to his vemit, and with the waſhed Sow to wallowing againe in the mire.</hi> It is poſſible for a man to eſteeme of Chriſt meerely for eaſe; he would be freed from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29795:105"/>
but not from ſinne; he would be eaſed of the burden of ſinne, I meane thoſe horrors, and terrors, and wounds, and affrightments, which it workes: he would be delivered from paine, and the hell of ſinne, but he cares not to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the impurity and filthineſſe of it. Now where Chriſt is welcome and accepted onely for ſuch an end as this, truely he counts himſelfe to be but little ſet by: ſuch an eſteeme of Chriſt is but an occaſionall eſteeme of him, a divided eſteeme, &amp; a diſproportionable eſteeme, which he doth nothing eſteeme of: and it declares a ſoule quite deſtitute of faith: and Chriſt cannot be precious where there is no faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is diſcover'd to us a <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> fit object whereupon to ſpend the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of our beſt affections; wee ſhould labour to place all our ſweet affections that are to be exerciſed upon good, as love, joy, and delight, upon this love-deſerving object Chriſt. It is pittie wee ſhould loſe ſo much of our affections as wee doe upon worldly things: when we ſuffer a pure ſtreame to run through a dirty channell, our affections to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the things of the world, wee doe but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29795:105"/>
loſe our affections, and they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable unto us.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, that the love of Chriſt is not alike in all the Saints, ſome are more, and ſome leſſe intenſive in their love to Chriſt. Wee all know that in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, there is not ſo much ſtrength in a finger, as there is in the arme: ſo in the myſticall body of Chriſt, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have not all of them the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and abilities of grace. And it is poſſible alſo to ſleepe ſpiritually, while the heart, that is to ſay, the life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt affection of the ſoule, is waking. <hi>I ſleepe</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>but my heart waketh,</hi> Cant. 5. 2. The meaning is, that ſhee was ſomewhat ſecure, and kept not that watch againſt the pleaſures of this life, and the baits of this world, as ſhee ſhould doe: and yet her heart was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſtill. So the wiſe Virgins ſlumbred and ſlept as well as the fooliſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 5. And yet they had <hi>oyle in their Lamps,</hi> and were ready to go in with the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome. <hi>The ſpirit may be willing, when the fleſh is weake,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith. Nevertheleſſe, it were to be wiſhed, that every childe of God had heavenly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in him at the height, and like an
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29795:106"/>
arrow drawn up to the head: And wee muſt take heed, that our puſility and dwarfiſhneſſe in them do not flow from a vicious and adulterate love: love of the world, love of eaſe, love of any thing more then Chriſt. Many of Gods deare ones are not without ſome tincture of this; they have, as it were, fits of it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as we may ſee by thoſe excuſes, which the Spouſe makes, when Chriſt did knock at the doore of her heart for entrance; <hi>I have put off my coat</hi> (ſaith ſhee) <hi>how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Cant. 5. 3. 'Tis a Metaphor taken from thoſe that are gone to bed, and are loath to riſe for any mans pleaſure: and the meaning may be this; that ſhee had now ſhaken off many feares and troubles; ſhee was free from perſecution, &amp; delivered from many afflictions and miſeries formerly endured; ſhee had now thrown off theſe things, as one going to bed doth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſhee had waſht them off; as in the Eaſtern Countries travailers were wont to waſh off the ſoile of their feet, when they went to their reſt; and ſhee was now in the bed of fleſhly eaſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contentment, loath to diſreſt her ſelfe,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29795:106"/>
loath to riſe, and to be pincht with cold againe, loath to ſet her feet into the dirt of former ſufferings: though in her heart ſhee preferr'd Chriſt above all; yet ſo ſweet were thoſe earthly accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſhee would rather forbeare intercourſe with him for a while, then loſe her ſhare in them. Thus it was with her: but this was a naughty temper, and coſt her deare to be purg'd of it. The true and healthfull temper of the ſoule is, when Chriſt is a joy to us, even in the abſence and want of all other things; when wee can ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; neither ſhall fruite be in the vines; the labour of the olive ſhall faile; and the fields ſhall yeeld no meat; the flocke ſhall be cut off from the fold; and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet I will rejoyce in the Lord; I will joy in the God of my ſalvation, Habac.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This may diſcover unto us, what ſingular effects the excellency of Chriſt have upon the hearts of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and how eminently their affections are drawn out toward him. Wee may judge of our eſteeme by our affections, and chiefly by the affection of love.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29795:107"/>
Love is the height of our eſteeme, and there are in it theſe three acts, or effects, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Complacency, or well-pleaſedneſſe.</item>
               <item>2. Deſire of union, or enjoyment.</item>
               <item>3. Benevolence, or good will.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, Complacency, or well-pleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being referred to Chriſt, is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection whereby wee doe approve and like of all that is in him, reſting in his goodneſſe, as in the moſt lovely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable object in the world. <hi>Thy love is better then wine</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſavour of thy good ointments, thy Name is as ointment powred forth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe the Virgins love thee,</hi> Cant. 1, 2, 3. This Scripture ſhews what a pleaſing and delightfull object Chriſt is to a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoule. What more acceptable to taſt, then fragrant wine? Chriſt is farre more to a Beleever. What more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the ſmell, then ſweet ointments of an exquiſite compoſition? Chriſt is the ſame, and far ſweeter to the heart of a beleever. The judgement the Church hath of the love of Chriſt is, that it far excells all the pleaſures and delights of the world, ſynecdochically ſignified by wine, one pleaſant ſpecies or kinde for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29795:107"/>
all the reſt: and <hi>his Name,</hi> that is, the knowledge of him, by preaching of the Goſpel, is powred out like odoriferous ointment, to the unſpeakable delight of the Saints, drawing and raviſhing the mindes of them that heare it, as virgines are drawn with the offer of ſome lovely match. Now where Chriſt is ſuch a pleaſing and delightfull object: where the ſences of the ſoule are ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken with his ſweetneſſe: where there is ſuch a totall acquieſſence in Chriſt, and ſuch a full, abſolute, and univerſall reſting in him; it is moſt evident and undeniable, that there cannot but be a high and worthy eſteeme of him. The beſt of Gods Saints and ſervants have liked of Chriſt, coming with a frowne, as well as with a ſmile, with a rod, as well as with tender and ſweet embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings: though there hath been ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance in the fleſh, and averſeneſſe in nature: yet to the new man within, to the ſanctified and regenerate part, Chriſt hath been ever welcome, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and in what ſhape ſoever he hath offered himſelfe. Indeed Chriſt hiding, and abſenting himſelfe, ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his light, and withdrawing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29795:108"/>
from the ſoule; this hath ever been bitter and unſavory to the Saints, and never could they beare it with any pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; becauſe they thought Chriſt to be utterly loſt and gone: they thought Chriſt to be no Chriſt: but in other things, though never ſo tart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, Chriſt hath been acceptable enough: <hi>Lord, if it be thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) bid me come unto thee on the water:</hi> ſo it is with the Saints, they refuſe not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter even upon the boiſterous water to goe unto Chriſt: Chriſt is welcome to them upon any termes: ſcourging and whipping Chriſt, as well as ſtroaking and embracing Chriſt. When <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Eli</hi> of judgements to come upon his family; <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him doe what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18. If it be the Lord that doth it, it is no matter, I will beare it. So <hi>David; I was dumbe and opened not my mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea, even in ſpirituall deſertions, when Chriſt hideth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and vaileth himſelfe from the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29795:108"/>
ſoule, the Saints are enough wel-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him: though the tentation be full of amarulency and bitterneſſe<hi>:</hi> yet in Chriſt himſelfe there is abundant ſweetneſſe and ſatisfaction: hence was that reſolution of <hi>Job; though he kill me, yet I will truſt in him.</hi> Hence alſo it is, that the children of God, though they walke in darkneſſe, and have no Light at all, yet they will truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay themſelves upon their God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50. 10.</p>
            <p>Though ſome weake ones doubt of this and call it into queſtion; and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſometimes in fits of deſpaire: yet the more exercitate of the Saints; thoſe among them, that are as bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and tried ſouldiers, they cannot be beaten off from the comfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it: and therefore in the depth of darkneſſe and tentation, when Chriſt hides and turnes away his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving countenance, they reſolve to wait for better times: I will waite upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and I will looke for him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8. 17. and notable to this purpoſe is that of <hi>Job: Behold I goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but he is not there; and backward,</hi>

               <hi>or ſcool'd,</hi> as the word ſignifieth, he was a man of experience, <hi>and experience wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hope,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith: and therefore in the depth and bottome of all his miſerie Chriſt was a Light, a ſtay, and a comfort to him. Now whence is it, that the Faith and graces of the Saints are ſo impregnable? whence is it that their hope is ſo inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29795:109"/>
and never out of breath? whence is it, that no ſtormes or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of tentation can breake their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and make them give out, but from that complacency and well pleaſedneſſe, from that exceeding ſwavity and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they find in Chriſt? ſo that let him preſent himſelfe how hee will, they are never offended, as to flie off from him, and to give him the ſlip for ever. <hi>A bundle of Mirrhe</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>is my welbeloved unto me: he ſhall lie all night betwixt my breſts, Cant.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Myrrhe</hi> is very ſweet of ſmell, and <hi>leniter amara,</hi> meanely, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bitter in taſte, as the <hi>naturaliſt</hi> writeth: ſo is Chriſt in this world a kind of a bitter-ſweet unto his Saints: but yet his ſweetneſſe doth (as I may ſay) ſwallow up all his bitterneſſe: his bitternes is in the loweſt degree; but his ſweetneſſe in the ſuperlative: ſo that let his diſpenſations be what they will, his Saints are never weary of him: yea they take pleaſure in infirmities, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for his ſake: and when they be weake in themſelves, then they are ſtrong in him, and more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29795:110"/>
as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſuch is the force of that pleaſantneſſe and lovelineſſe, that is in Chriſt, that neither the ſhame of his owne poverty and croſſe, nor his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſet fire in the earth, holding forth ſuch a Doctrine, as makes wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men rage like Devills, and makes his owne people to be in the midſt of feares and troubles, and Chriſt himſelfe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his face and love from them: ſuch I ſay, is the force of his pleaſantneſſe and amiableneſſe, that none of theſe bitter things could ever make the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt wearie of their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or cut off the race and ſucceſſion of them.</p>
            <p>There is a remarkable paſſage to this purpoſe <q>In <hi>Joſephus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note>; At that time, ſaith he (meaning when <hi>Pilate</hi> was Governour) was Jeſus, a wiſe man; if it be lawfull to call him a man: for he was the performer of diverſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable workes, and the inſtructure of thoſe, who willingly entertaine the truth. And he drew unto him divers <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Greekes</hi> to be his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: this was Chriſt; who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the Princes of our Nation
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:29795:110"/>
before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the croſſe by him; yet did not thoſe, who followed him from the beginning, forbeare to love him for the ignominy of his death: for he appeared unto them alive the third day after, according as the Divine Prophet had before teſtified the ſame, and divers other wonderfull things of him. And from that time forward the race of Chriſtians, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their name from him, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you ſee what an honourable teſtimony this <hi>Jew,</hi> that was no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, gives of Chriſt and his Diſciples: ſo precious and deſirable was hee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſuffering, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the ſhame and trouble that came upon his followers for him, that they never would forſake him, neither could the generations of them be rooted out of the Earth unto this day.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, from complacency, or wel-pleaſednes flowes another thing in love, <hi>viz.</hi> a deſire of union, or enjoyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. When the ſoule eyes a tempting or tickling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29795:111"/>
as I may ſay, it preſently covets the poſſeſſion and fruition of it: there is by and by a kinde of claſping or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with it, or a ſtrong appetion of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity, or private Intreſt. Whence it is that the French Divine writeth <note place="margin">Molinus.</note> thus of love. <q>Love (ſaith he) is that point of our ſpirits, whereby it joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it ſelfe unto objects. That which is weight in heavie things, love is the very ſame in our ſoules: for as weight moveth earthly bodies toward the place of their reſt<hi>:</hi> ſo love moveth our ſoules toward that object, which promiſeth reſt and contentment.</q> Now Beleevers highly eſteeming Chriſt, deſire nothing more then the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of Chriſt. Now Chriſt is enjoyed</p>
            <p>In his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>In his ſecret and ſweet appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to the ſoule, and in his perſonall preſence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt is enjoyed in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. The Ordinance is (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) a walke wherein Chriſt is wont to meet with his people: a Beleever therefore doth with great delight and ſtudy put himſelfe upon that way, that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29795:111"/>
he may enjoy Chriſt in it. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is enjoyed in his ſecret and ſweet appearances to the ſoule. What are all holy Ordinances, but dead and heartleſſe things without ſuch revelations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> tells us of Ordinances of Heaven; and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in like manner of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Sun, of the Moone, and of the Starres: theſe are naturall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: but to what purpoſe were they; if this inferiour world did not partake of their light and heat, and ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence? Wee read alſo of politick and Judiciall Ordinances, which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ſet in the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but to what purpoſe were theſe likewiſe, or what benefit could an Iſraelite reape by them, if he lived in ſuch corrupt and lawleſſe times, that he could not have them adminiſtred? ſo what are all heavenly and ſacred Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to a Beleever; if he finde not the vertue, the life, and the power of them, enjoying Chriſt in the Ordinance, and finding an influence of his ſpirit and grace flowing in upon his ſoule? As there is a deſire in a Beleever to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his heart unto Chriſt; ſo Chriſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29795:112"/>
communicates his grace unto a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers heart. Chriſt as a Fountaine, ſends forth his ſtreames of comfort and joy: and as a Sunne, ſends forth his glorious beames of grace and love into a Beleevers ſoule. Now a Beleever doth account prayer, preaching, Sacraments, and all other meanes of his ſoules wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare to be nothing; unleſſe the Spirit of Chriſt comply with them, flowing in upon the ſoule with ſuch heart-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing diſcoveries of his grace, as no tongue can poſſible expreſſe. Hence it is, that a Beleever ſets open the windowes of his ſoule, deſiring that Chriſt may ſhine into it, with the bright and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beames of his grace and favour; but if Chriſt eclipſe and hid himſelfe from the ſoule, there is nothing but darkneſſe and complaining, ſorrow and mourning, and no reſt at all; untill the miſt be diſpelled, and the cloud blowen over, and the day-ſtarre ariſe in the heart againe; untill Chriſt come and refreſh the ſoule with new ſupplies of revelations. The Church never left off ſeeking Chriſt; untill ſhe had found him; till the King had brought her into his bed-chamber, and into the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting-houſe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29795:112"/>
and imparted ſome of his love unto her. Oh how precious is that ſweet and ſecret communion, which a Beleever enjoyes with Chriſt! ô! what a delight is it to ſit under Chriſts ſhadow, and to enjoy him in ſuch a way, at this is?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is enjoyed in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall preſence at his ſecond coming. The Saints are deſcribed to be ſuch, as long and looke for Chriſts appearing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>you come behind in no gift</hi> (ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of Chriſt it now hid; but then his brightneſſe ſhall appeare and be manifeſted; for he ſhall come in the clouds and great glory. And the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. that <hi>Chriſt ſhall be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> that is, the Saints ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſhine as the Starres for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and to be made conformable to the glorious body of Chriſt, they ſhall infinitely admire his grace and Mercy unto them. Hence it is Beleevers wait for the conſolation of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29795:113"/>
of Chriſt, as they did for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of his firſt coming; becauſe here they receive good in promiſe, but then they ſhall receive it in the fruit of the promiſe: here they receive the firſt fruites of his Spirit, then a full harveſt of joy and bleſſedneſſe: here they ſee Chriſts glory at a diſtance, and through the latteſſe, but then in the luſter and brightneſſe of it; Chriſt is the object of a Beleevers affections, and nothing but fruition will give him ſatisfaction: his heart is never at reſt, untill it come to his proper place of reſt and repoſe; agreeable to that of the Father, <hi>feciſti nos Domine ad te, &amp; inquietum eſt cor noſtrum donec requieſcit in te,</hi> thou haſt made us ô Lord for thy ſelfe, and our heart is never at reſt, till it reſt in thee. Now whence is it, that a Beleever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to enjoy Chriſt in his Ordinance, in that ſweet and ſecret communion, in his perſonall preſence, but from this love of union: when he ſees ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious object, as Chriſt is, he deſires to claſpe and cloſe with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from complacency, or wel-pleaſedneſſe, and from union and enjoyment flowes a third thing in love,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29795:113"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> benevolence or good-will. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence being referred to Chriſt, is an affection whereby wee doe yeild our ſelves wholly unto him, deſiring his name may be glorified by us. The Saints cannot properly conferre any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall goodneſſe, or glory upon Chriſt; but onely make an agnition and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement thereof. <hi>Can a man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) be profitable unto God, is it any pleaſure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Job</hi> 22. 2. that is, if a man were juſt and holy, yet hee could not profit God, or adde any joy and delight unto him. Againe in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 16. 3. <hi>Thou art my Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) my goodneſſe extendeth not to thee:</hi> that is, I cannot enlarge and enrich God; but (ſaith he) <hi>to the Saints on Earth,</hi> in whom is my delight; that is, as for thoſe that beare thy ſtampe and ſuperſcription upon them, I will entertaine with my goods: thus we may wiſh well to Chriſt in his members.</p>
            <p>Againe, this love of benevolence doth carrie and containe in it a willingneſſe to yeild all obedience unto Chriſt. He that loves Chriſt freely, cannot but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pleaſe him in all things, and be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29795:114"/>
like unto him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 17. And he that keepeth his word, in him is the love of God perfect, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Love is the condeſcending to the loweſt ſervice, it is impulſive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, it hath a ſweet kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to draw the heart of a Beleever unto the obedience of Chriſt: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraines us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. And ſo in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Love is ſtrong as death, and Jealouſie is cruell as the grave.</hi> That is, love is that ſtrong affection which cannot be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by trouble or tentation; it is as ſtrong as death: the heart (as ſome ſay) is <hi>primum vivens, &amp; ultimum mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> the firſt living, and laſt dying, and therefore all the vitalls of the body drawes to the heart, and unites there; whence it is a man gives ſuch ſtrong plunges at his death, becauſe his ſtrength is united: ſo love doth unite all the affections of a Beleever drawing them forth to act for Chriſt<hi>:</hi> and for zeale or jealouſie, that is, love enflamed and fervent, and it is fierce and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as Hell and the grave: that as Death and Hell devoureth, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up all; ſo love to Chriſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29795:114"/>
all oppoſition and ſuffring, and makes Beleevers <hi>rejoyce to fill up</hi> (that is declaratively) <hi>the ſuffring and affliction</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>of Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, the unmatcheable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> and preciouſneſſe of Chriſt muſt not lye as a contemned thing: but it calls for the utmoſt ſtrength of our ſoules, and the height of our affections to be fixed upon it. There is no object in the world, but there is a will relating to it, and inclinable to cloſe with it. Now what better object can the will of man have, then Chriſt? if wee be not here, what doe wee differ from beaſts? and a beaſt in the ſhape of a man is worſt of all. 'Tis good for us, that God hath placed affections of love, of joy, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and the like in our ſoules: but if theſe be not placed upon Chriſt alſo, it were better that we were quite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and were as uncapable of Chriſt as the moſt inſenſible and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures that are. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then what may yet farther elevate our affections, and cauſe them to mount up with wings as Eagles unto that delight of all delights, and abſtract of all prayſes. This will be, if we look
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29795:115"/>
upon thoſe rich and coſtly gifts, which Chriſt hath beſtowed upon Beleevers, and they are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>The bloud of Chriſt is precious in <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Mot: </seg>1</label> theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the purity of his humane nature, which was <hi>holy, harmeleſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and ſeparate from ſinners:</hi> to God, to man, and to it ſelfe it was wholly without ſpot and blemiſh, and had not the leaſt touch of ſinfulneſſe in it. In nature the beſt conſtitutions have the beſt bloud<hi>:</hi> never was there a better tempered, a more purely conſtituted nature, farther from the corruptions, freer from the pollutions and groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of ſinne, then Chriſts was. It behoved him as man to <hi>fulfill all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> and throughly to come up to the patterne of Legall types; which did all ſhadow him abſolutely holy, and ſpeake him perfectly pure without the leaſt tainture of ſpirituall defilement.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29795:115"/>
Now if the bloud of the Saints, who are but in part ſanctified, dregs of ſinne remaining in the beſt, be precious in Gods account, as wee read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 15. how much more then is the bloud of the Sonne of God precious; who never went awry, never failed in the leaſt jot, or title of due obedience to the Law of God? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>for a good man peradventure ſome would even dare to dye, Rom.</hi> 5. 7. and why ſo? but becauſe 'tis great pitie ſuch precious bloud ſhould be loſt: now if their bloud be ſo precious, that are but imperfectly good, what then was his, who was good without any mixture of evill?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts bloud was noble bloud, and therefore precious. He came of the race of Kings, as touching his manhood: but being with all the Sonne of God, this renders his nobility match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and peereleſſe. 'Twas <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> bragge, that he was the <hi>Sonne of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kings, Iſaiah</hi> 19. 11. Who can lay claime to this more then Chriſt? who can chalenge this honour before him? he is the Sonne of the ancienteſt King in the world: he was begot a King from all eternity; and the bloud of Kings is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29795:116"/>
precious: <hi>thou art worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> ſaid <hi>David's</hi> Subjects to him; and therefore they would not ſuffer him to hazard himſelfe in the battell, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3. his Life-bloud was of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, then if halfe of his people had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, becauſe he was King and had the Soveraignty: the nobleneſſe of his perſon did ſet a high rate upon his bloud; and whom doth this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more commend unto us, then Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the bloud which Chriſt ſhed for his people, was his life-bloud. Life is the moſt precious thing that a man hath. As the life of God is the ſumme of all his attributes: ſo the life of man doth eminently containe in it all other bleſſings: all that hee hath ſerves to maintaine it: it is the end and drift of all his enjoyments. What could Chriſt doe more then to ſpend his heart-bloud, and to lay downe his life for us? <hi>Sanguis eſt vehiculum vitae,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician:</hi> the bloud is the Chariot of life: yet Experience teacheth that there may be great effuſion of bloud, and yet no death following. Had Chriſt almoſt emptied all his veynes, and not dyed,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29795:116"/>
this would not have reached to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: it had not been ſufficient to ſave us from death: even thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>drops of bloud;</hi> which hee did ſweat in his agony, had nothing availed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death. Death is the ſumme of the curſe due to us: in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die the death: Chriſt then dying for us, here was the accompliſhment of all his ſufferings, and the height of his love towards us: Surely that bloud muſt needs be very precious, which could not be let out, but the vitall ſpirits muſt follow after it. Thoſe that profeſſe skill in words, doe derive <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, bloud from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifieth to burne, or to kindle: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be a true etymologie, or not, I will not diſpute: the heate that is in the bloud of a living creature (if at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in good temper) ſpeakes for it: ſure I am, that the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt ſhed for our ſinnes both teſtifies his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and burning love toward us, and requires a like affection in us, the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fiering of our love toward him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the preciouſneſſe of Chriſts bloud appeares likewiſe from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:29795:117"/>
union of his manhood with his God-head. The Divine and humane natures of Chriſt ſubſiſting together in one, and the ſame perſon, is called an hypoſtaticall union: properly the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies a placing, or ſtanding under: when the Godhead ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the manhood, and the manhood is taken into the ſame perſon with the God-head, this is hypoſtaticall. Now from this marvellous and wonderfull union floweth, though not a reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of properties, yet a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuous predication of them, as if they were all alike common and naturall to both natures. Hence the manhood is ſaid to be in heaven even while it was circumſcribed &amp; compaſſed with a place on earth, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. and on the other ſide, the bloud of the humane nature is called the bloud of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and elſe where by reaſon of this union God himſelfe is ſaid to be crucified. Oh how precious was the bloud of Chriſt then! doubtleſſe it had more worth in it then all the creatures in Heaven and earth, Angels and men, and all the world beſide. The uniting and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the cooperation and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29795:117"/>
of the impaſſible Deity in the ſame perſon with that ſoule and body, which ſuffered, muſt needs put infinite dignity, and preciouſneſſe beyond all account upon the bloud of Chriſt: yet this was not thought too deare for his Saints.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, the bleſſed effects of Chriſts bloud is another ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the ineſtimable value and price of it.

            <p>Againe, the bloud of Chriſt obtaines eternall redemption for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. whence it is that the Apoſtle oppoſes it to Gold and Silver<hi>:</hi> though theſe be among the moſt precious things that the Earth affords; yet being corruptible and tranſitory, they cannot purchaſe incorruption and eternity for us. The bloud of Chriſt is the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: <hi>yee are bought with a price,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. and a like phraſe he uſes in the end of the precedent chapter: yet there is neither a pleonaſme in the words, that is to ſay, a fulneſſe of ſpeech, though that ſometimes be rhetoricall enough: nor impropriety, or unfitneſſe of Language, as if a thing could be bought without a price: though, I confeſſe, the Scripture in ſome reſpects doth ſometimes ſpeake ſo: neither is there an hebraiſme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by words of the ſame ſignification are itterated and repeated <hi>ob vehementiam,</hi> to ſet the matter on with the greater ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency and force: but the word price
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29795:118"/>
is uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſhew the ſuperlative excellency and dignity of the price wherewith the Saints are bought<hi>:</hi> ſo that, ye are bought with a price is as much as to ſay, yee are dearely bought, 'twas a price with a witneſſe, that was given for you, a price of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, a price paſt the number of a man: it cannot be calculated or ſummed up, it is ſo infinite, ſuch a rich and exceeding price is the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, coſtly and chargeable were our ſoules, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch a ranſome. This is the price wherewith wee are bought from the earth, bought out of Hell, and bought into Heaven and everlaſting glory. This is the price that redeemeth us from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and this is it that cleanſeth us from the filth and ſtaine of ſinne. This is it that purgeth our Conſciences from dead workes to ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 14. The Apoſtle in that place draweth an Argument <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

If typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rites and ſacrifices, as the bloud of Bulls and goates, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinckled upon the uncleane, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for externall Sanctification, namely for the purifying of the fleſh le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29795:119"/>
and ceremonially; how much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon our Conſciences, purge away the guilt of ſinne, and avayle to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, ſpirituall, and everlaſting ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of our perſons.</p>
            <p>Againe, by this bloud it was that Chriſt, as the high Prieſt of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that is of Chriſtians, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Chriſt entred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y his owne bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place:</hi> hee did not enter into the preſence of God as the high-prieſt of old did with the bloud of Goates, and Calves: what ſhould thoſe ſlender things doe in the Tabernacle made without hands? there are no ſuch meane and poore offerings there. Neither did Chriſt enter to offer for himſelfe, as well as for his Family, as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 6. he had no need of expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe: but he went into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to offer for his people only: whom he hath for ever waſhed, juſtified and ſanctified <hi>not with bloud of others</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) <hi>but with his owne bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, from the precious bloud of Chriſt, we alſo that are ſo cleanſed and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:29795:119"/>
purged <hi>have boldneſſe to enter into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, Heb.</hi> 10. 19. 20. The bloud of Chriſt breeds us and begets us this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. The Apoſtle in that place doth covertly oppoſe the liberty of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unto the reſtraint of them that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the Law. The <hi>Jewes</hi> of old might not preſſe into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: it was lawfull onely for the High-Prieſt to enter into it, and that but once a yeare. Great in this regard is our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence now above Gods ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: they might not paſſe ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthly Sanctuary incloſed with materiall walls, and coped with a roofe: but wee have licence and leave to enter into a farre more holy and undefiled place. Chriſt hath conſecrated or initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a way for us<hi>:</hi> hee hath trod the path firſt as our fore-runner; and hee hath done it by his bloud, or as (the Apoſtle ſpeakes) <hi>through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh:</hi> he alludes to the vaile of blew and purple ſcarlet and fine twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned linen, which was to divide the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all from the reſt of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. That vayle was a type of Chriſts fleſh. Now as the High-prieſt of old en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the holieſt by removing of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29795:120"/>
veile: ſo Chriſt by the death of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did as it were turne aſide the veile, and ſo hath entred into heaven, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of holies, there to make interceſſion for us. Yea by the renting and tearing of that veile of his fleſh upon the croſſe, he hath for ever opened a way for all Beleevers: a new and a living way: that of old is obſolete and vaniſhed, this is ſuch as the vigour thereof ſhall never decay: that of old being by the bloud of beaſts, could not give life to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, this being by the bloud of Chriſt, revives and raiſes up them that are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, and doth alſo conferre eternall life upon them. O how precious, beyond all thought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt? the bloud of a moſt righteous perſon, moſt noble bloud, the very life and heart-bloud, the bloud of God, juſtifying, ſanctifying, redeeming bloud; bloud purchaſing eternall redemption for us, bloud that quickeneth us, and conferres both ſpirituall and everlaſting life upon us. Laſtly, Bloud that opens to us a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decaying way into Heaven. How precious, I ſay, is this bloud of Chriſt? and how doth it call upon us to ſtirre
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29795:120"/>
up our affections to embrace Chriſt, to lay hold of him, and to love him with a moſt ardent and unfained love, who hath beſtowed ſuch a precious gift up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Beleevers precious Graces. Grace is called by the Apoſtle, the renewing of the Holy-Ghoſt, and the forming of Chriſt in us. It conſiſteth in the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and conformitie of our will unto the will of God, and to Chriſt the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute patterne of all grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the image of the inviſible God, <hi>the expreſſe character of his Fathers bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: the Sun of righteouſneſſe, the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtarre,</hi> moſt eminently and gloriouſly above all others; <hi>chiefeſt of ten thouſand</hi> for ſweet and gracious deportment. How precious are thoſe qualities of the ſoule, which come neare ſuch a patterne as this? which imitate, reſemble, and take after ſuch unmatchable beautie? Now all grace is precious; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives that Epithite eſpecially to faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is the roote and wombe (as I may ſay) of all grace; it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29795:121"/>
is the inward fountaine and principle, from whence all grace flowes; it is the mother grace; it purgeth the conſcience, and purifieth the heart, and ſo breedeth every needfull grace in us. You may ſee this genealogie or pedigree of grace, notably delineated by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. There we finde that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or love, which is the fulfilling of the commandement of God, and a chiefe grace or Chriſtian vertue, flows from a pure heart; and a pure heart ſprings from a good conſcience; and a good conſcience is the off-ſpring of faith. Faith is the Genetrix and breeder of Grace, as <hi>Eve</hi> was the mother of all mankinde. I ſpeake ſo in reſpect of an internall principle; for if we regard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cauſes; the race and genealogie may be ſtretched farther; as thus, faith comes by hearing of the word of God; the word of God is declared by the mouth of a Preacher; and every true Preacher is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſent from heaven. But I muſt ſpeake <hi>ad rhombum;</hi> though there be ſundry externall efficients and workers of grace, yet faith is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall roote and principle of it: and that is one reaſon why it is called precious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:29795:121"/>
Secondly, it is precious in reſpect of its Author, which is the Father, Sonne, and Spirit. The Father draws us unto Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. And hence wee are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be <hi>taught of God,</hi> and to <hi>heare and learne of him.</hi> The Sonne likewiſe draws us: <hi>draw me; we will run after thee,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe. Chriſt is both the <hi>Author and the finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. He caſts in the firſt ſeed of it; and alſo makes it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere: he layes the foundation of it, and brings it up to the roofe, as I may ſay: he makes us firſt to apprehend him, and then leads us to the end of our faith, which is the ſalvation of our ſoules. Whence it is that he is called the <hi>Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> that is, he is the teacher of our faith, and the Captain thereof. Laſtly, the Holy-Ghoſt is likewiſe the Author of our faith. <hi>No man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but by the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 3. And in the ninth verſe of that Chapter, faith is reckoned among the gifts of the Spirit. Faith then muſt needs be very precious, having God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy-Ghoſt for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:29795:122"/>
Thirdly, Faith is precious in reſpect of the object thereof, that is to ſay, the thing upon which it leanes, or reſts, which is God himſelfe, or God in Chriſt. God is ſaid to <hi>be in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, and not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. Now this is the higheſt and moſt excellent object of faith. Chriſt alſo as Mediatour is the object thereof. <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Lead me unto the rocke that is higher then I,</hi> Pſal. 61. 2. And the rock that he ſpeaks of is Chriſt: he is the ſtrong rocke on which his Church is built firmely and unmoova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Needs then muſt faith be precious, while it leanes on ſuch a ſolid and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt foundation. Againe, the promiſes are metonymically an object of faith: becauſe they are made unto us in Chriſt: they are in him as adjuncts in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: we reſt upon the power and truth of Chriſt, for the obtaining of that good which is in the promiſes. <hi>All the promiſes of God are in him yea, and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. He is mediate, or in the middle between the promiſes and us: God makes the promiſes, and Chriſt is his pledge and aſſurance for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29795:122"/>
of them: ſo that faith reſts on the promiſes of God, <hi>mediante Chriſto,</hi> through the mediation of Chriſt: and anon you ſhall ſee what precious things thoſe promiſes are: in the meane while, we may conclude even from them likewiſe, that faith muſt needs be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which hath ſuch precious props and pillars to uphold it, God &amp; Chriſt, and a ſure word of promiſe, all the wiſdome and power of the Father, and the Sonne, and the Spirit, all that they can doe to eſtabliſh and confirme their own word, and that is more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The preciouſneſſe of faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the nature, from the effects and workings of it. The nature of it is piouſly to know, and to affect the things of God: to cleave unto God in Chriſt, to reſt upon him for the obtaining of the promiſes. Faith joynes us to God, who is our life, in whom the lives of our ſoules are bound up, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> life was bound up in his darling <hi>Benjamins.</hi> Faith filleth the ſoule with ſolace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, with peace paſſing all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and with joy everlaſting. As bloud is in the veines, diſperſing it ſelfe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29795:123"/>
into all parts of the body, ſo giving life and heate and continuall nouriſhment thereunto: ſuch is faith in the ſoule; it works upon all the affections; it diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and ſheddeth abroad in our hearts the love of God in Chriſt; it attracts and draws our ſpirits to delight in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then in Chriſt; it entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoule with feaſts of fatted things, and of wines refined; it leadeth it into the <hi>wine-cellar;</hi> it invites us unto thoſe <hi>apples and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ggons</hi> of pleaſure, which Chriſt hath prepared; it ſweetens the croſſe; it makes us to rejoyce in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that with joy unſpeakable and glorious; it workes in us a childe-like confidence toward God, whereby wee approach boldly to him, <hi>crying, Abba, Father;</hi> it carrieth the ſoule up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and giveth raviſhing ſights of God and Chriſt, and the joys of eternitie; it brings us into communion with God, whereby we have moſt intimate and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar conference with him; it brings us into his <hi>bed-chamber,</hi> into his galleries of love. In a word, it enlightens, juſtifies, ſanctifies, and ſaves us for ever; becauſe it lays hold on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is made</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>unto us of God, wiſdome, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:29795:123"/>
               <hi>and ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith. O how precious is faith, that hath ſuch wonderfull vertues and operations, as theſe? how precious alſo are thoſe graces, that flow from it, as love, and the feare of God, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and patience, and the like? But above all the reſt, how precious is Jeſus Chriſt, and how highly to be eſteemed of, who hath beſtowed upon us ſuch precious, ſuch royall, and ſuch rich gifts as theſe?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider likewiſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Mot. </seg>
               </label> of Chriſt; theſe are alſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and precious, as they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. I confeſſe that by promiſes he meanes the effect of the promiſes, or the things themſelves that are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which are of no ſmall value and worth; and therfore the promiſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are of no little weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This will eaſily appeare, if wee conſider
<list>
                  <item>The nature of the promiſer.</item>
                  <item>The antiquity of the promiſes.</item>
                  <item>And the precious things, which they containe.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:29795:124"/>
Firſt, God, who hath promiſed, is by nature wiſe and powerfull, true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. God is infinitely wiſe, he hath a profound reach; his counſells are very deepe: even his fooliſhneſſe is <hi>wiſer then men,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith: and he knows wayes beyond our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and capacity, how to bring about his owne ends, and to accompliſh his promiſes. He is alſo almighty to effect and bring to paſſe his deſignes: he can doe above all that wee can either aske or thinke. And againe, he is true and cannot lie, and therefore he is called the <hi>God of Amen</hi> by the Prophet, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65. 16. And laſtly, he is unchangeable; he cannot repent: there is no variableneſſe or ſhadow of turning with him: all theſe are the <hi>fulera,</hi> the props and ſupporters of the promiſes, on which they ſtand firme and ſure, and cannot fall to the ground. The ſaying is <hi>Pollicitis dives quilibet eſſe poteſt.</hi> Every man can be rich in his promiſes: even a beggar may be as rich as a King in promiſes: but all the queſtion and doubt is about the performance of them. Among men it is frequently thus: they are facile and forward in making of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29795:124"/>
but they are ignorant of the meanes how to fulfill them; or if they know the way; yet they want power and abilitie; or if they be both know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and able; yet they want a will; they have a heart and a heart, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes: they pretend, what they never intend; The children of men are deceitfull upon the ballances: or laſtly, though they know how to be as good as their word, though they can doe it; yea though for the preſent they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend what they promiſe, yet <hi>Multa cadunt inter ealicem ſupremaque labra.</hi> many things fall out between the pot and the lip, as the proverb is; they are fickle and inconſtant, well inſtructed how to play faſt and looſe, unſtable as water, like <hi>Reuben:</hi> and ſo their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes prove to be nothing worth: perhaps the fault may be in their intellect and underſtanding: though they be wiſe to day, yet after a while they may grow ſots and fooles, and ſo know not how to ſteere their courſe, and to wheele a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their purpoſes; or perchance the default is in their hands: though they be in poſſibility of performing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29795:125"/>
to day, yet to morrow their armes may be cut off, and they are left ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; or if not ſo; yet it may be worſe; the fault may lie in their affections; they may be honeſt now, and after a while diſhoneſt; and ſo ſay, and unſay; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and change their mindes. Thus it is with men oftentimes; but with God it is not ſo; he knows how to performe his promiſes; he is able to make them good; and he is moſt true and faithfull in all his pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſions: yea he is ever wiſe, ever powerfull, ever true, ever the ſame, never altred or changed in the leſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: how precious then and ſweet are his promiſes? and how lovely alſo ought Chriſt to be, by whom we enjoy them? Thus much of the nature of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the antiquity of the promiſes. The maine and chiefe promiſe of God is that which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eternall life, and this was made at the beginning of the world unto <hi>Adam,</hi> when God ſaid, that <hi>the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould breake the Serpents head:</hi> yea it was made before the world began, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>In hope of eternall life</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which God that cannot lie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:29795:125"/>
               <hi>before the world began.</hi> Here by the way we learne, that the promiſe being before all time, it muſt needs be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and without all condition. But let that paſſe. The queſtion is to whom that ſo ancient a promiſe was made? when there was yet no world, nor any men created to receive it, to whom did God make it? I anſwer, that it was made to him that even then was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be our head and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>diatour, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the eternall Son of God. The Elect are called the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ede of Chriſt,</hi> Eſa. 53. 10 and <hi>his children, Heb.</hi> 2. 13. Now as wee were in <hi>Adams</hi> loyns when he tranſgreſſed: ſo as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the decree and counſaile of God, we were (as I may ſay) in the loynes of Chriſt from all eternity, and before the world began: and ſo the promiſe was made to him for us, or to us in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all moments or meaſures of time. But you will aske mee perhaps where we finde ſuch a promiſe? I anſwer, that wee have ſuch a promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>I will declare the decree: the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee. Aske of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:29795:126"/>
               <hi>the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> In this Scripture marke two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That God the Father ſaith of his Sonne, <hi>this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And [this day] ſignifies both time and eternity. Time as touching the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt from the dead: that was done in time, as you know; and the Apoſtle applyes the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> unto that very matter of Chriſts reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33. And to the ſame purpoſe he is called elſewhere the <hi>firſt begotten of the dead.</hi> Againe [this day] ſignifies eternity. It is moſt certainly to be beleeved, that God did beget his Sonne before all time, even from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. There is a place to this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4, 5. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt hath a more excellent Name then the Angells;</hi> becauſe God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid of him, <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> which he never did ſay unto any of the Angells. And marke I pray, the Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt obtained this more excellent name <hi>by inheritance,</hi> as being Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Sonne: and therefore he had it from everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In this day of eternitie (if
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29795:126"/>
I may ſo call it) God makes unto his Sonne a promiſe of a Church to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered among the Heathen. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was ſtipulated in the nature and manner of a decree: and all Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are eternall, and co-etaneous with himſelfe: moſt true is the theoreme of the Philoſopher; <hi>a voluntate antiqua non procedit actio nova:</hi> from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will (he means from Gods will) there doth not proceed any new act. God doth not begin to will any thing; he doth not will any thing afreſh; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever he wills, from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie he will'd it: his will from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting is one moſt pure and ſimple act: it is ſometimes called a decree: but yet in reſpect of himſelfe it is no ſuch thing: for a decree ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome intervall of time to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the purpoſe and the execution: and ſo there is, I confeſſe, in reſpect of us: but to God it is not ſo; for he is without all predicament of time: <hi>one day is as a</hi> 1000 <hi>yeares, and a thouſand years as one day with him:</hi> thoſe things that are paſt and to come with us, are eternally preſent with him. But to come to the point. Though the counſells of God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29795:127"/>
be not properly decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in reſpect of himſelfe, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the reaſon before alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: yet they are from eternitie, and that is the thing that we drive at. The forementioned decree of gathering a Church from among the Heathen, was made when the Sonne of God was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: and he was begotten of old from everlaſting, as we have prooved. And it was not onely a decree, but a promiſe alſo; it runnes plainly in the forme and tenor of a promiſe: <hi>Aske of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then conſider; how precious is that promiſe that was made in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar parlie and conference between the Father and the Sonne from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Chriſt was foreſeene and ordained even of old to be our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: upon this ground God makes even then a gracious promiſe to him for us; a promiſe of giving us to him, and conſequently of giving us eternall life through him. So that here wee have plainly the reaſon why the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God promiſed eternall life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began?</hi> Namely, becauſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29795:127"/>
Chriſt was even then in the counſell and purpoſe of God our Media<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our. And hence in another place, he ſaith, that <hi>the grace of God, whereby wee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with an holy calling,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly everlaſtingly ſaved, <hi>was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9. Chriſt Jeſus was even then lookt upon as our Redeemer: God ſtipulates and promiſes to him; and he againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulates to undertake for us. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the promiſe of eternall life muſt needs be exceeding precious, being the ſubſtance of that Dialogue (as I may ſay) and communication, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the Father and the Sonne before the world was created. And if that great promiſe be ſo ancient, then queſtionleſſe ſo are all promiſes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe eternall life doth eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in it all other bleſſings, juſt as the heaven of heavens doth all inferiour parts of the world. Now how ſhould the conſideration of this ſtirre up our hearts to love Jeſus Chriſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived promiſes for us, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee our ſelves were, but even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any time, or creature made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:29795:128"/>
Thirdly, Conſider the precious things that are couched in the promiſes, and they appertaine either to temporall life, or to ſpirituall grace, or to eternall glory.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Great and precious are the promiſes, which doe appertaine unto this life. <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath the promiſe of this life, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> And even in this reſpect, God <hi>hath promiſed never to leave us, nor forſake us,</hi> Heb. 13. 5. There are in this place no leſſe then five negatives to ſtrengthen and confirme our faith in the truth of the promiſe; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; as if he ſhould have ſaid, I will in no wiſe whatſoever come of it at any time forſake thee; mine eye ſhall be ſtill upon thee, and I will watch over thee for good continually. And marke, I pray, what the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, in his love and in his pitie hee redeemed them, and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> The place may be read interrogatively thus, <hi>Was he not afflicted?</hi> &amp;c. That is, did he not take to heart the wrongs done to his people in <hi>Aegypt? Was not</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:29795:128"/>
               <hi>Chriſt the Angel of Gods preſence</hi> their Conductor and Saviour? <hi>Did hee not beare them,</hi> as a tender Mother or Nurſe doth her young childe? <hi>Did he not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them as the Eagle doth her broode,</hi> with ſuch care, that ſhee her ſelfe may not hurt them, and at ſuch a height, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may not reach them? In ſuch manner doth Chriſt for ever protect his people. In <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 5. he promiſes to be <hi>a wall of fire round about them:</hi> where the Holy-Ghoſt alludeth to the practice of Travailers in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who by ſurrounding themſelves with a fire, did thereby fray away the wilde beaſts, and kept them off from annoying them: now ſuch a defence will Chriſt be unto his Saints; he will be with them in moſt deadly dangers, <hi>When they paſſe through the water, and when they walke through the fire,</hi> Eſa. 43. 2. Fire and water are two moſt devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elements, good ſervants, but bad maſters, as we ſay; and therefore here they are put for all other perilous and dangerous kindes: Chriſt will ſave and deliver his people from them all. Wee reade, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. that the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were caſt into the fiery furnace:
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29795:129"/>
But what ſaid the Tyrant? <hi>I ſee foure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the fourth is like the Sonne of God:</hi> and in all probabilitie it was ſo; it being uſuall under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Chriſt, upon ſome weightie occaſions to appeare in humane ſhape. Thus Chriſt will be with his people in the furnace of affliction; and either he will provide that it ſhall not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heate, or elſe he will worke a miracle to reſtraine the power of the flames: he will both preſerve them in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of trouble: he will ſo ſanctifie affliction, that it ſhall prove a very bleſſing and mercy to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Great alſo and precious are the promiſes, which appertaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſpirituall grace: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That by them we partake of the divine or godly nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. He doth not meane it of the eſſence or ſubſtance of God, as ſome of the Heathen conceited, affirming man to be <hi>aurae divinae parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> a little piece of the divine Spirit: Thus did the <hi>Platonicks</hi> dreame, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Priſcillianiſts:</hi> not ſo, I ſay; for the eſſence of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable: but wee are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the graces of the Spirit,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29795:129"/>
whereby the image of God is ſtampt againe and reſtored in man: therefore the Apoſtle doth not call it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, the eſſentiall nature of God: but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the godly nature; as if he had expreſſed it in one word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Sainthood, or a nature approaching to Gods, reſembling and like unto Gods. So that Beleevers through Chriſt have in their ſoules a lively image and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the perfections, of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and of the life of God: according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him:</hi> he puts knowledge, which is the incipient part of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the whole, including under that both holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. And anſwering to this is that precious promiſe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65. 17. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>That he will make new heavens, and a new earth:</hi> This is meant of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall excellency of the Church, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both of doctrine, of diſcipline, and of life: and therefore it holds forth a promiſe concerning the renewing of the ſoule by the Spirit of the Lord: where doctrine is ſound, diſcipline wholeſome,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29795:130"/>
and life holy, there are new Heavens and a new earth, as I may ſay, and there the ſoule is become a new creature by the ſanctifying Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, great and precious alſo are the promiſes appertaining to eternall glory: they containe in them that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance of the Saints in Light, where they ſhall have bleſſed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, with Chriſt, with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, with elect Angels, and with one another for ever: where they ſhall have the quinteſſence of all good things, the ſweetneſſe of all Mercy and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: where they ſhall have the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and bright rayes of everlaſting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; where after this life (and this life is but a bubble, a ſmoake, a wind, a ſhadow) they ſhall have that unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; immortall Crowne of glory ſet upon their heads, which Chriſt hath promiſed: in a word, where they ſhall have <hi>totum quod volunt, &amp; nihil quod nolunt,</hi> all that they would have, and nothing that they would not have. Hence it is, that the Goſpel, which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth the promiſe of theſe things, is termed glorious, and the miniſtration thereof likewiſe glorious. And therefore
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29795:130"/>
as the Apoſtle makes the compariſon between the Law and the Goſpel: <hi>if the miniſtration of death and condemnation be glorious</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how ſhall not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Spirit and of righteouſneſſe be rather glorious?</hi> ſo may I ſay: if the glory of Chriſt be ſo ſplendent and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo attractive and alluring even in the promiſe and expectation of it: what then will it be in the full fruition and enjoyment thereof? if ſo excellent and ſurpaſſing at a diſtance, and through the lattice, as I may ſay: what will it be in the neereſt touch and viſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when wee ſhall come our ſelves to participate of that glory? <hi>Now wee ſee but in a glaſſe darkely,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. that is, here wee ſee God but as we ſee our owne Image in a glaſſe, and not the very face it ſelfe; here wee ſee him by a kinde of reflection, and at ſecond hand, as I may ſay, in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in the creatures, and ſuch like dimme repreſentations, which at the fartheſt are in ſome ſenſe aenigmaticall, full of intricacy and obſcurity. But then wee ſhall ſee God face to face; and then we ſhall know him, as we our ſelves are knowne by him, that is to ſay, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29795:131"/>
I meane with ſuch a perfection as a glorified creature is capable of. Thus have I ſhewed unto you what excellent and precious things are contained in the Promiſes for our ſoules, and for our bodies, for this life and for the life to come for ever: ô then how much more precious and excellent, how much more to be deſired and longed for is Jeſus Chriſt, by whom ſo manifold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable bleſſings are conveyed unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſt hath beſtowed up-Beleevers <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Mot: </seg>4</label> precious love, and precious it is, becauſe Infinite.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Gracious.</item>
               <item>Liberall.</item>
               <item>Everlaſting.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, the love of Chriſt unto his Saints is infinite and unmeaſurable: it is beyond all imagination or concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 9. Now who can underſtand with what love the Father hath embraced his Sonne? who can dive into the bottomeleſſe depth of that tender affection, which the infinite God beareth unto Chriſt? no more can wee define and fully ſet forth what the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29795:131"/>
love of Chriſt unto his Saints is? The Apoſtle indeed would have the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans able to comprehend with all Saints, the breadth, and length, the depth and height of the love of God in Chriſt:</hi> but yet for all that hee concludes, that it <hi>paſſeth knowledge, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 18. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts love is a gracious love. That which the Lord ſpeakes by his Prophet concerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> may fitly be applyed to all his people, <hi>When I paſſed by thee and ſaw thee polluted or tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot,</hi> as the word ſignifieth) <hi>in thine owne bloud, I ſaid unto thee live.</hi> That is, (as we uſe to apply it ſpiritually) when we were in our naturall filthineſſe and uncleaneneſſe, which we drew from our firſt Parents, God loved us freely, and not for our worth or merit; not for our beautie or comelineſſe: wee had no worth in us, nor no beauty upon us: yet he loved us, and ſaid unto us live, that is, he made us to live ſpiritually; he did put the life of grace into us: he did breath into the noſtrills of our ſoules (as I may ſay) the breath of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life<hi>:</hi> his ſaying in this new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was as his ſaying was in the firſt Creation of all things: he did but ſpeak
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29795:132"/>
the word, and it was done. Againe, he addes in the forementioned Propheſie, verſe the eight, <hi>I ſpread my skirt over thee.</hi> He alludeth to a cuſtome or Ceremony of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> whereby at Mariages, the Husband in token of his Intereſt and propriety, and alſo as a pledge of his moſt tender love and endeared affection to his wife, did cover her with a lappe or skirt of his garment: now this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall rite was a figure of the merit of Chriſt, who hath by his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe covered all our ſinnes and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, veiled all our filthineſſe and polutions, and hid all our ſpirituall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and deformities, and that moſt freely, moſt graciouſly, moſt undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, according to that <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 4. <hi>I will heale their back-ſliding; I will love them freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts love to his Saints is a liberall love, a munificent, a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and bountifull love<hi>:</hi> this appeares plainely by thoſe hard and bitter things, that he underwent for us, <hi>Philip,</hi> 2. 7. the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>he made himſelfe of no reputation: he tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe, or habit of men.</hi> The originall word in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:29795:132"/>
the place ſignifieth, that he emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or <hi>redegit ſe ad nihilum,</hi> he brought himſelfe, as it were to nothing: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted and ſtript himſelfe of the robes of Divine Majeſty, laying them, his Throne, his Crowne, and his Scepter of Glory aſide for a while. Through the extremity of his agony his body did ſweat drops of bloud: he did exhauſt ſuch an infinitely rich and precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as all Heaven and earth could not recompenſe and make up againe. It is reported of the <hi>Pelioan,</hi> that ſhe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her breaſt with her bill, and feedeth her young ones with the bloud diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from her: and therefore (ſaith mine Author) the Egyptians did make that kinde an hieroglyphick of Piety and pitie, and upon that conſideration they ſpared them at their Tables. Now this creature is a lively picture and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of Chriſt: he parted with that, which was moſt deare unto him; the ſoule in his body, the bloud in his veines, and (which was more then all the reſt) the ſweet and raviſhing appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his Fathers love eclipſed, and darkned in his agonies, and ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eclipſed, that he cryed out with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29795:133"/>
a loud voyce, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? And all this he did in his infinite pitie and love to us<hi>:</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, that he <hi>loved his Church and gave himſelfe for it,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſts love is eternall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting: a love that never decayes or waxeth cold; like the ſtone <hi>Aſbeſtos,</hi> of which I read in <hi>Solinus,</hi> that being once hot, it can <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iul. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin: poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſtor. cap.</hi> 12.</note> never be cooled again. The love of Chriſt is like a Fountaine ever flowing, and never dried up: or like the ſacred fire, which never went out. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>with everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy upon thee.</hi> Though the Saints offend Chriſt often, yet he loves them ſtill: he onely purges them and heales them of their ſpirituall maladies, which cannot be done without ſome ſmart: but he doth not a whit leſſon, or detract his love from them. Though his people come upon him every day for new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and new ſupplies; yet his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will is never wearied or tired out<hi>:</hi> yea though thouſands, millions of his Saints preſſe upon him at once; yet hee hath for them all, and the Fountaine of his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29795:133"/>
love is never emptied. I like the matter of the Poet very well; although, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his verſe be ſomething jiggiſh and toying.</p>
            <l>Sumit unus, ſumunt mille:</l>

            <p>One Beleever drawes water of life, and ſupply of all needfull bleſſings out of this well of ſalvation; and a thouſand like gracious ſoules doe the like; and the one drawes as much as the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: and yet the well is never drawne drie. Now then a little to recapitulate. If the love of Chriſt unto his Saints be infinite, boundleſſe and unmeaſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r it be liberall, rich, and bountifull. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it be eternall, everlaſting, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decaying, ô what a whetſtone ſhould this be to our affections, what a ſpurre to our Spirits, and what a bellowes to blow up, and kindle the fire of our love to Chriſt? nothing doth more conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate and attract love, then love it ſelfe: it were horrible ingratefulneſſe not to ſpend, and be ſpent (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) for one that hath loved us ſo much as Chriſt hath done: certainely if
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29795:134"/>
love doe not draw us unto him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will. The acts of Chriſts love are the cords wherewith he drawes ſoules unto himſelfe. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 11. 4. and in another place, <hi>with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 3.</note> 
               <hi>loving kindneſſe have I drawne thee*.</hi> 'Tis an Argument then, that wee are not drawne at all, if love doe not effect it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Chriſt beſtowes upon Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Mot. </seg>5</label> his precious Spirit. This is that, which Chriſt promiſeth to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>The comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he ſhall teach you all things, &amp;c.</hi> Now let us conſider how excellent the Spirit is, in all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it upon our hearts, and then we ſhall ſee what a precious and lovely gift this is.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Chriſt doth theſe things.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all, the Spirit of Chriſt doth illuminate the mind and underſtanding<hi>:</hi> it opens the windowes of the ſoule, as I may ſay, and ſets up a new Light in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29795:134"/>
it: it brings in light upon light. Even by nature men have ſome Light, ſuch as it is: by Art and induſtry they acquire more: but the ſaving Light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt farre excelleth all that of the naturall man, as the Light of the Sunne doth the light the Moone, or as the Light of ſeven dayes doth the light of one: hence is that Spirit by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency called <hi>the Spirit of wiſdome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> and it is ſaid <hi>to lead us and to guide us into all truth, Joh.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>I have many things</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: but you cannot beare them now: but when the ſpirit cometh; he ſhall lead you into all truth,</hi> that is, he ſhall open your underſtandings, he ſhall enlarge your capacities, and ſhall make you able to comprehend thoſe Divine and heavenly Myſteries of the Kingdome of God, which ſhall be diſpenced unto you. <hi>Yee have an unction from the Holy one</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and yee know all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. The Holy one here ſpoken of is the whole Trinity, God the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt: the unction is not the Spirit it ſelfe: but a thing different from the eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof: <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29795:135"/>
and ſaving Knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the eyes of our minds being anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as with an unction, wee come to know all things, not abſolutely, and omniſciently, as God doth<hi>:</hi> but to know all things that are needfull to be knowne unto ſalvation. And hence in the 27. verſe, the ſame anoynting is ſaid <hi>to teach us,</hi> and that wee need no other teaching, but that: it is called <hi>eye-ſalve, Revel.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Spirit of Chriſt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the hearts and natures of Beleevers, whereby they are really changed from the filthineſſe of ſinne unto the purity of Gods Image; that as Chriſt himſelfe is holy, ſo are they in ſome meaſure by an inherent holineſſe<hi>:</hi> their love and their hatred, their joy and their ſorrow, all their paſſions and affections, are not ſuch as they were before, but they are quite altred and changed, new-moulded and faſhioned, made after Gods owne heart, and conformed to his holy will. This is the bleſſed worke of the Spirit: <hi>We are ſanctified through the Spirit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the truth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. The Spirit is principall in ſtamping the Image of God upon the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:29795:135"/>
ſoule: the Spirit it is that doth convey the efficacie of Chriſts death and bloud unto us. Hence it is called in Scripture wind, fire, water, and the like.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is a winde. <hi>Awake ô North, and come thou South, Cant.</hi> 4. 16. and that for theſe reaſons. As wind allayeth heate: ſo the ſanctifying Spirit of God aſſwageth hot and burning diſtempers in the ſoule; it ſuppreſſes inordinate and luſtfull deſires, moderating all our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and keeping them in a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Againe, as wind purges the aire, and dries up ſuperfluous moyſture in the earth: ſo the Spirit purgeth our corrupt natures, and dries up the excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours of ſinne, which are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to ſpirituall health. Alſo <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>ur à ſavendo,</hi> from che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of fruits and other things.</note> as the wind is a great fructifier, cauſing the fruits of the earth to ſpring out: ſo the Spirit of God makes that ſoule, which naturally is as a barren and dry wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, no plants of grace growing in it; but the weeds of ſinne rankling every where, to be a fruitfull and flouriſhing garden, where Chriſt delights to walke and to take his repaſt, beholding how his trees of Righteouſneſſe doe ſpread, and bloſſome, and beare moſt pleaſant
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29795:136"/>
fruit. When the wind of the Spirit doth blow upon the garden of the ſoule, then the ſpices of grace flow out: then Chriſt may come into his garden and eate his delicious fruits of union and Sanctification. The ſoule is not now an emptie vine, neither doth it beare wilde grapes; it doth not beare grapes of gall and bitter cluſters, but fruites of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and holineſſe, moſt ſweet and well reliſhing, moſt pleaſing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Againe, the wind is a quickning and enlivening thing: the breath of every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature is a winde: <hi>Come from the foure winds ô breath, and breath upon theſe ſlaine, that they may live,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 9. Now ſuch is the Spirit of God alſo: it raiſeth up the ſoule from the death of ſinne, and puts the life of grace into it: it ſets us upon our feet and makes us to walke before God in the Light, and in the land of the living.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As the winde is not in the power of any man, <hi>it bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith; and it is impoſſible to hide it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 16. So the Spirit of regeneration is not at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29795:136"/>
will, and diſpoſing of any creature: but it is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> at its owne choice and diſpoſing, at its own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when, where, and how it will breath and diſpenſe grace: <hi>Of his owne will begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Spirit of ſanctification is alſo called fire in the Scriptures; <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy-Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. It reſembles fire in the purging property thereof; as fire is a great purger, attracting and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupt aires to it ſelfe, ſegregating &amp; ſevering pure ſubſtances from droſſe, as wee ſee in the trying of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: ſo doth the fire of the Spirit draw away from our ſoules all peſtilent and infectious ſents of ſinne, and by little and little purges away all the droſſe of our corruptions.</p>
            <p>Againe, The Spirit reſembles fire in the conſuming property thereof: fire purgeth onely, when it meets with a ſubſtance that can endure it: but when it lights upon combuſtible matter, then it waſts and conſumes: ſo the fire of the Spirit doth no more then purge the hearts of the Elect: yet it waſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29795:137"/>
their luſts, becauſe they be things to be waſted and aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Spirit of grace reſembles fire in the aſſimilating property thereof: fire turns other things that are approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate into its owne nature: it makes things hot, as it ſelfe is hot: it propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and ſpreads it ſelfe, increaſing its own flames by licking up and catching in other things to it ſelfe: ſo the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit of God doth fire our hearts and affections, heating them with his own heate, kindling them with his own ſacred ſparkes, aſſimilating and making us like unto himſelfe: holy as he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pure as he is pure, and perfect, as he is perfect. The ſoule being acted and wrought upon by the Spirit, is changed into the ſame glory, and becomes ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall like it ſelfe. Wee know that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will ſmell of the muske or civet that is put in it: ſo a ſoule endued with the Spirit of grace, cannot but become gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: it muſt have the ſame ſavour, the ſame odoriſerous and pleaſing ſent that the Spirit it ſelfe hath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The precious Spirit, which Chriſt beſtows upon his Saints, is called water alſo; becauſe as water waſheth
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29795:137"/>
away the filthineſſe of the fleſh; ſo doth that Spirit the uncleanneſſes of the ſoule. And againe, as water hath a ſoftning and ſuppling vertue with it: ſo the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit of Chriſt doth mollifie and ſoften hard hearts; making them of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable and inſenſible to become bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite, of ſtubborne and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to be flexible and pliable unto Gods holy will: ſo that though they were before like Leviathans heart, as hard as a piece of the neither milſtone; yet now they can tremble at judgements, ſubmit to commands, and be glad to cloſe with the promiſes of Chriſt. Thus you ſee that the Spirit which Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon his Saints, is a ſanctifying, a purging a regenerating, and a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This Spirit ſealeth our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our filiation or ſon-ſhip unto us. By adoption wee are received into the number of the ſonnes of God; and by the Spirit of Chriſt we come to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this prerogative. The Spirit of God ſeales up our ſalvation and bleſſed ſtate unto us: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That God hath ſealed us and given us the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Spirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:29795:138"/>
22. He hath given us the earneſt of his Spirit for the aſſurance of our heavenly inheritance. The Apoſtles manner of ſpeaking is taken from the cuſtome of men, who to aſſure and confirme others in the truth of their promiſes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, are wont to ſet their ſeale to bills and bonds, and ſuch like inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo God ſets his ſeale to all his promiſes, and to the covenant of grace, which he hath plighted with us, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us his holy Spirit to renew us, to imprint his image upon our ſoules, and to beare witneſſe within us, that we are his children, and conſequently heires of life and glory everlaſting. Now this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is expreſly called <hi>the Spirit of the Son, Gal.</hi> 4. 6. Becauſe the Holy-Ghoſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up our adoption in Chriſt: ſo that through Chriſt it is made ſure unto us. Let us now ſumme up all which hath been ſaid of this gift: if Chriſt hath not withheld his gracious Spirit from us, but hath given even that unto us, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us, to ſanctifie us, and to aſſure us of our adoption and ſalvation: where can we finde greater favour then this? and where ſhould our mindes be lifted up into the opinion of any thing more
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:29795:138"/>
then of Chriſt? Doubtleſſe, the giver of ſuch a precious gift, ought himſelfe to be much more precious unto us. If wee make great account of the gift, much more ought we moſt highly to eſteeme of the beſtower of it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt beſtowes upon Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Mot. </seg>6</label> precious priviledges: and they are many: but I will ſpeake onely of theſe two.
<list>
                  <item>Acceſſe to the throne of grace.</item>
                  <item>Good ſucceſſe of our prayers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Beleevers have bleſſed acceſſe; <hi>Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that wee may obtaine mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. The Apoſtles phraſe is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a word which ſignifieth libertie of ſpeech, and boldneſſe of face, when a man intrepidly and undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utters his minde before great ones, without bluſhing, without weakneſſe of heart, without ſhaking of his voyce, without haluccination, imperfection and faltring in ſpeech; when neither majeſty nor authority can take off his courage, ſo as to ſtop his mouth, and make him affraid to ſpeake. With ſuch ſpirits would the Apoſtle have us to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29795:139"/>
come unto God by prayer: wee muſt come with pareſie, with confidence of heart, and freedome of ſpeech. This is a fruite of our acceſſe to the throne of grace, to which doubtleſſe the Apoſtle would never have exhorted us, if wee were not bleſſed with ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Againe, A like exhortation wee have <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neare with a true heart,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith,</hi> that is, in ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith, without wavering, without doubting. The Apoſtle meanes it of our full aſſurance of Gods favour, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our perſons in Chriſt. In the Law the high Prieſt going into the Sanctuary, did beare upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in his pectorall or breſtplate, the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now this figures unto us the great love that Chriſt beares unto his people: he hath them alwayes at his heart; hee loves them moſt tenderly and dearely: he beares them alſo upon the ſhoulders of his mighty protection, carrying them a loft out of the reach of all adverſary power. And he is gone into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:29795:139"/>
with the names of his people upon his breaſt, for a memoriall before the Lord continually: ſo that now through his mediation we may draw neare unto God in plerophorie, and full aſſurance of faith: nothing doubting but that God will for his ſake accept both of our perſons and of our prayers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beleevers have not onely acceſſe to God, but alſo good ſucceſſe of all their ſuites and petitions, which they put up unto him. Chriſt by his office of mediation and interceſſion, is an advocate for his people, and doth in his own perſon appeare before God for them: he takes upon himſelfe their ſuite and their cauſe, as an Advocate in Law doth his Clients. Hence is that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweet and conſolatory promiſe of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man ſinne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wee have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Here is never a word, but hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it. Marke, I pray; firſt he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſinne;</hi> not as though there were ſome that did not ſinne: for that this very Apoſtle beats againſt expreſly in the end of the firſt Chapter: but when
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29795:140"/>
he ſaith, <hi>If any man,</hi> he ſpeakes cordiall things, he ſpeaks to the heart and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſinners, ſhewing that with God there is no accepting of perſons; but all without exception of any for exteriour adjuncts and qualities, doe finde grace in his fight through Chriſt: this is plainly the inference of the indefinite particle, <hi>Any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaith, <hi>That wee have an Advocate:</hi> an Advocate is a forenſicall word, and it ſignifieth properly one that is called to, or aſſumed as an Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as a friend, as an helper, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor: ſuch Advocates did guiltie ones among the Greeks and Romans aſſume to themſelves. Now ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate is Chriſt unto us: he is our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, he is our ſpokeſ-man, he it is that pleadeth our cauſe for us; he it is that by the merite of his expiation doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for us. The Devill is called our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>our Adverſary,</hi> another Law-terme, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. he lays in hard againſt us; and therefore he is elſewhere called <hi>the Accuſer of the Brethren:</hi> and guiltie we are too: but Chriſt is our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>our Advocate,</hi> and he intreats the Judge for us: he implores mercy and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:29795:140"/>
Thirdly, The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>wee have an Advocate with the Father;</hi> with him ſtill at his right hand: ſo with him, that he is his own naturall Sonne: ſo with him, that he needs but onely ſhew himſelfe for us, and without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any word wee are accepted. <hi>At that day</hi> (namely at that day when I ſhall be aſcended into heaven) <hi>yee ſhall aske in my Name</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I ſay not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himſelfe loveth you; becauſe yee have loved mee, and have beleeved, that I came out from God,</hi> Joh. 16. 26, 27. In theſe words Chriſt bids us not ſo to depend and hang upon him, as to have no confidence in God the Father, as if he were angry with us, and did not love us. Chriſt is ſo an Advocate with the Father, as that the Father is made ours fully and perfectly: and ſo the eager and malicious adverſary can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our Advocate is Jeſus, a moſt ſweet and heart refreſhing name; it ſignifieth a Saviour; one that doth not onely intreate for us, but perfectly ſave us: other Advocates may intreate, and not prevaile; but Chriſt intreates
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29795:141"/>
and prevailes; and ſo ſaves his people from their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, He is called Chriſt; there's an addition and increaſe of comfort in this name; it ſignifies anointed. Chriſt was anointed to be our Prophet, to ſhew us the waies of life and ſalvation: he was anointed to be our Prieſt, to offer a reconciling ſacrifice for us. And he was alſo anointed to be our King, to protect us, and to deſtroy all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Our Advocate is called the Righteous, by an eminency, none ſo righteous as he: he is perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: ſo that he needs not, as other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, to plead for himſelfe: he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely for us: and he muſt needs have good ſucceſſe in his pleading; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is righteous himſelfe: he is the Righteous; juſt, and a juſtifier; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and compleatly righteous by his own inherent purity; and conveying righteouſneſſe to us by imputation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, our Advocate is ſuch an one as ſtands in our roome, and takes the whole penalty and puniſhment due to us for our offence upon himſelfe: therefore the Apoſtle addes, that he is <hi>the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:29795:141"/>
               <hi>for our ſinnes,</hi> that is, he is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that implores and begs pardoning Mercy for us. Hence <hi>the bloud of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> that is, the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſaid <hi>to ſpeake better things then that of Abel, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. for of <hi>Abels</hi> God ſpeaks thus: <hi>the voyce of thy brothers bloud crieth unto me from the ground. Abels</hi> bloud cried unto God for vengeance to be executed upon <hi>Caine</hi> that murdered him: but the bloud of Chriſt crieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for mercy to be ſhewed unto poore miſerable ſinners. Now then if Chriſt be our Advocate, if he be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, alwayes in his preſence, alwayes neere and deare unto him; if he be an Advocae mighty to ſave; if he be an Advocate ſeparated and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified of God himſelfe, and anoynted to beare Office for us; if he be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate perfectly righteous and blameleſſe in his owne perſon; if hee be ſuch an Advocate, as is willing to ſtand in our ſtead, and to beare the burden of our deſerts, like him that cried out when he ſaw his friend ready to be ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:29795:142"/>
ſuch an Advocate as refuſes none, but receives all without exception, that come unto him: if Chriſt, I ſay, be ſuch an Advocate, ſuch a dayſ-man, ſo every way qualified and furniſhed to doe us good; then ſurely it cannot be, but that the prayers, which we preſent unto God in his name, muſt finde acceptance, and obtaine a glorious returne. <hi>Whatſoever you aske the Father in my name; he will give it you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23. Chriſt puts incenſe upon our prayers and mingles them with the ſweet odours of his owne merits: he is the onely Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Chriſtians, ſanctifying all their gifts and ſacrifices. Thus you have a taſte of the excellent priviledges of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers<hi>:</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt they have acceſſe to the Throne of Grace; and all their petitions find acceptance with God, returning (as the Spies did out of <hi>Canaan)</hi> with great and weighty clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of bleſſings, or (as <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes did from their brother <hi>Joſeph)</hi> full and loaden with good things. Oh then how precious, how lovely. how longed for ought Jeſus Chriſt to be, who accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and heapes ſuch royall favours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? who ſtores us with ſuch rich and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:29795:142"/>
ineſtimable gifts, who gives us free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe into the preſence of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe from him with joyfull hearts; who makes way for our prayers, that they may come as things of worth unto his Father, and ſends them back againe with good newes, and glad tidings of bleſſed ſucceſſe: how precious, I ſay, and how highly to be eſteemed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded is ſuch a Benefactour as this? how ought wee to draw out all our love, and the very ſtrength of our affections to caſt them upon ſuch a lovely object as this, and to embrace Jeſus Chriſt, who hath done for us <hi>above all that wee can either name, or thinke?</hi> I paſſe now to ſome meanes by which we may awaken, and ſtirre up our affections unto Chriſt. And herein I ſhall give no other directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the Church doth to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the occaſion was this. The Church was ſeeking Chriſt earneſtly, and diligently, and in her ſeeking, enquires of the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for her beloved: upon which the daughters utter theſe words. <hi>What is thy beloved more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beloved, ô thou faireſt among women?</hi> The Church for anſwer, and as a meanes
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:29795:143"/>
to draw forth the affections of the daughters; ſets forth exactly the high perfections and excellencies of Chriſt: &amp; ſhee doth anatomize him in every part, and particularize him in every excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſetting him forth thus<hi>:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the Church deſcribes Chriſt in generall, and that two wayes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Poſitively.</item>
               <item>2. Comparatively.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, poſitively; <hi>my beloved is white and ruddy,</hi> verſe 10. that is, he is of the moſt compleate, perfect, healthy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The ſtrongeſt complexion and conſtitution is noted by theſe two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; white and ruddy: and it denotes unto us the power and omnipotency of Chriſt, whereby he is able to doe the greateſt things in the world. Alſo his <hi>whiteneſſe</hi> denoteth his purity and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: and <hi>ruddy;</hi> his owne bloud and ſufferings; and likewiſe his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his enemies, for he <hi>hath his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dipt in bloud, Iſaiah</hi> 63. 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, comparatively, <hi>he is the chiefe of ten thouſand:</hi> or <hi>having</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the banner above ten thouſand.</hi> Chriſt is the Standard bearer of ten thouſand, that doth excell all men and Angels, and all
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:29795:143"/>
other creatures in the world. Now in Armies the goodlieſt men uſe to carrie the Enſigne or banner,: ſo Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable beyond all other, and hath the perfections of Angels, of men, and of all creatures beſide. Againe, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is a warlike Inſtrument, and the bearer thereof, one of the chiefe: ſo Chriſt is <hi>for the Enſigne of his people, Iſa.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>And all the Armies in Heaven and earth doe follow him, Rev.</hi> 19. 11. the Saints they worſhip him, the Angels they adore him; for he is <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah:</hi> and he is the <hi>firſt-borne of God, ſet above all the Kings of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church deſcends from her generall commendations of Chriſt, to that which is more particular, ſetting him forth by all the members and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his body.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Church begins with Chriſts head, which is the moſt eminent part of all the body. <hi>His head is as the moſt fine gold, verſe</hi> 11. that is, Chriſt hath a head moſt glorious and excellent, moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſhining, as pure as gold. This denotes unto us the beautie, dignity, eminency, and government of Chriſt.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:29795:144"/>
As gold is of a ſplendent and durable nature; ſo is the government and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt everlaſting and durable, it is Divine and heavenly, and of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extent.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>His locks are curled, and black as a Raven,</hi> verſe 11. Blacke and curled locks are a ſigne of a hot braine, and they doe argue quickneſſe, and dexterity of wit and ſtrength: this denotes to us the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſtrength of Chriſt, and the depth of all his counſels.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>His eyes are as Doves eyes by the ſtreames of waters, waſhed with milke, and fitly ſet,</hi> verſe 12. that is, his eyes are <hi>pure as Doves:</hi> ſo that he cannot behold any evill with the leaſt approbation<hi>:</hi> and they are <hi>quick</hi> to ſearch all things: and they are <hi>white as milke,</hi> in that he doth behold his people in grace and mercy: Laſtly, his eyes are <hi>fitly ſet;</hi> that is, as a Diamond in a ring, or, as the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling ſtones, which were ſet in the hollow places of the golden Ephod, <hi>Exod</hi> 25. 7. and thoſe ſtones were called <hi>ſtones of fulneſſe,</hi> becauſe they did fit the hollow places in that golden Ephod. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Chriſt hath ſteady eyes, he is not goggle eyed, (as we ſay) but his eyes
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:29795:144"/>
are ſteady and firme, they are as a ſtone ſet in a gold ring, which cannot be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of its place: ſo are Chriſts eyes evermore guiding his fight to looke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly into all things, both into the depth of Gods Counſels, and into the depth of mans heart and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Chriſts cheekes are as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flowers,</hi> verſe 13. that is, he is like a bed of ſweet ſpices, or growne plants, that ſerve for perſume. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes and ſhewes unto us Chriſts beauty and grace, his comelineſſe and gravity to all that doe behold him. All Chriſts graces are ſweet, and his fight &amp; counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance hath a transforming vertue in it, it makes thoſe that behold Chriſt to be like unto him, while others behold his glory, <hi>they are transformed into the ſame Image of his glory, from glory to glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>His lips are like dropping ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling myrrhe,</hi> verſe 13. The Lillies are faire and ſweet of themſelves; yet hee addes, <hi>they dropp pure myrrhe.</hi> This is to be referred unto the holy, heavenly, ſweet and gracious Doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>Honey and myrrhe,</hi> that is, love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, grace and goodneſſe did flow out of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29795:145"/>
Chriſts lips: ſo its ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 1. <hi>grace was in his lips.</hi> Chriſts heart was a treaſure full of all Divine grace and goodneſſe, then needs muſt his lips bee ſweet; yea, and farre ſurpaſſe in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe honey and myrrhe.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>His hands are as gold Rings, ſet with a berill, or Chryſolite,</hi> verſe 14. The he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> put for Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, ſignifieth a precious ſtone. The hands of Chriſt are ſet forth with all ornaments and precious ſtones, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rings of Gold. This denotes unto us not onely the perſon of Chriſt; but alſo his actions and workings. The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Chriſt are admirable and full of Majeſty, if we conſider them in the courſe of the creatures, in the Sunne, Moone, Starres, in the growth of hearbs and plants; ſo in all the Creation of the world, in gubernation, in ordering of the event of all things, and the like. The workes of God are incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as in <hi>Job,</hi> 9. 12. <hi>who ſhall ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him what doſt thou?</hi> that is, the things which he doth are too high for mans underſtanding. Now as all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Egypt</hi> went through the hands of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> ſo all the workes of God goe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29795:145"/>
through the hands of Chriſt. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath committed all his Judgements and workes into the hands of his Sonne, glorious therefore are the workes, which Chriſt doth performe both in Heaven and in earth.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>His breaſt, or belly is overlaid with Saphires, as bright Ivory, ver.</hi> 14. Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Saphires are precious and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull: and with theſe Chriſt hath his belly overlaid. This denotes unto us the bowels and inward affections, the tender mercy and pitifull commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt toward his Saints and Children.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>His legges are as pillars of Marble, ſet upon ſockets of fine gold,</hi> ver. 15. That is, Chriſts wayes are full of Majeſty and power, and as Marble pillars they are firme and conſtant, having ſockets of Gold to ſuſtaine them, and to beare up his feet, whereby his way is perfect, by which hee walkes ſafely, treading downe his enemies under his feet, and bringeth glad tidings of peace unto his people.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>His lookes, or countenance is as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon, excellent as the Cedars,</hi> ver. 15. that is, Chriſt was of a goodly and tall
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:29795:146"/>
ſtature, like unto the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> a goodly Mountaine on the north ſide of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This ſhewes the Majeſty and countenance of Chriſt, when he ſhall plead for his Church and people againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>His mouth, or palate is ſweet,</hi> ver. 16. this is the ſame with his lips, and ſhewes how ſweet and comfortable, how gracious and amiable the Doctrine of the Goſpel is, this expreſſion is here againe repeated to ſhew, that Chriſt is better knowne in Sion, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. All the workes of Chriſt are glorious, but his Goſpel exceeds them all in glory. The Goſpel is the glaſſe, wherein wee ſee the glory of Chriſt more clearely, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; therefore the words of Chriſt are much more ſweet to a Beleevers taſte, then honey or the moſt ſweeteſt of ſpices are unto the mouth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is precious and amiable in his whole ſelfe: <hi>yea, he is altogether lovely, ver.</hi> 16. that is, Chriſt is lovely in generall, and he is lovely in particular: he is lovely in all parts, and altogether: yea, he is altogether lovely. As if the Church ſhould have ſaid, what ſhall I
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:29795:146"/>
ſay more of my beloved? <hi>he is all over, and altogether lovely.</hi> Chriſt was lovely to God, to Angels, to Saints: hee was lovely in his nature and perſon, in his Offices and graces, yea, <hi>he is all over lovely,</hi> he is wholly delectable.</p>
            <p>The Church having thus deſcribed her beloved, ſhee concludeth with an exclamation; <hi>this is my beloved, and this is my friend, oh daughters of Jeruſalem:</hi> this is he, that I ſought with ſo much diligence, and for whom I was ſick of love: this is he, that ſhall have my beſt affections, in whom I deſire to glory in: <hi>this is my friend, oh yee daughters of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next words, wee may take notice of the effect, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Chriſt hath upon the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem. Whether is thy Beloved gone, oh thou faireſt among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? whether is thy Beloved turned aſide, that wee may ſeeke him with thee?</hi> The daughters hearing ſuch a high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from the Church of her Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, hearing of his riches and glory, and of his beauty and excellency, ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a deſire to ſeek Chriſt alſo.</p>
            <p>Now from this ſingular effect, which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:29795:147"/>
this commendations of Chriſt wrought in the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Miniſters of the Goſpel may learne and ſee what their chiefe dutie is; namely, to diſplay thoſe rich treaſures of grace, and that ſplendent ſhining glory, which is in Chriſt, to publiſh and ſpread before men thoſe manifold excellencies, which be in him, to draw and allure them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. The Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould imploy their whole force and ſtrength this way, that poore ſoules may be drawn to eſteeme highly of Chriſt. Who will ſeeke after that, which he knowes not off? and who will not ſeeke after a precious jewel? O then tell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where this jewel, this pearle, this treaſure is, that they may ſeek &amp; ſearch, and become Merchants for to adventure all for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſtudy then all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, riches, beauty, lovelineſſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the nature of Chriſt: meditate upon whole Chriſt, and upon all the parts of him; and never give over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou haſt ſweeten'd thy ſoule, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindl'd thy love, and fixed all thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon him. Meditate what Chriſt hath done for thee, what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29795:147"/>
him unto it; and likewiſe how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thou art, and how thankfull thou art, and let theſe meditations draw forth thy affections unto him.</p>
            <p>Againe, Feed upon Chriſts love; that which wee feed upon, turnes into our own nature: love is fuell for it ſelfe; love feeds upon love, and the perſon beloved: ſo let us upon Chriſts love: the more wee live upon Chriſts love, the more our love will be enflamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him. Kiſſe ſweetly the glorified body of our crucified Saviour, with the lips of infinitely indeared and unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible affectionate love: though the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be great between Chriſt and the ſoule; yet faith will bring them eaſily together.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Goe to the everlaſting foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Chriſts bloud; let the cocke run; rence thy ſoule (as it were) in the bloud of the Lambe; apply it for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſanctification; ſo ſhalt thou be free from the guilt and pollution of ſinne; thou doeſt aske but the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the debt being paid in Chriſt.</p>
